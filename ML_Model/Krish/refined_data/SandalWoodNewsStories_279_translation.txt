Summary of Key Points: - A detailed description of a site, including its size, history, and various structures like houses and medicinal stores. - The site encompasses 7 acres planted with medicinal herbs (4 acres) and agricultural crops (3000 trees on 30 acres), supporting approximately 9000 housing units for workers. - The economic value of the sandalwood harvested is estimated at INR 9 billion ($125 million). - Discussion on the ecological significance of the area, highlighting native tree species, natural regeneration, and soil health. - Emphasis on sustainable practices to protect the environment and ensure long-term viability of resources. - Challenges faced in land ownership due to historical policies favoring monopolistic control by entities like Karnataka State Sandalwood Development Corporation Limited (KSDL) and Regional Natural Resources Management Authority (RNNMRA). - Current regulations require selling raw materials like sandalwood logs to KSDL or RNNMRA before any processing or manufacturing can occur. These organizations handle grading, drying, fixing rates based on quality assessments after purchasing from farmers at predetermined rates followed by payments split into advance (20%) upon submission with final settlement post product drying period which typically lasts one day. However, there's an advocacy push for policy reform allowing direct transactions between farmers/private owners without mandatory intermediary involvement for better financial returns as well as government support for exploited farmers through association efforts led by individuals who have invested extensively in their lands over decades despite financial setbacks.
