 On August 28th of last year, which coincided with my second birthday, I welcomed my first plant of the year into my home. These plants were approximately three to four months old at the time and had begun bearing fruit. As they grew older—six to seven months from their initial planting—I named them after Pallid. Since then, they have flourished and are now nearly three to four times older than when they were initially planted. We successfully constructed an agroforestry system (referred to as "post plant") towards the end of July this year (2023), where we cultivated these matured plants across a 20-acre site known as 'Kijal,' which translates to 'Drier' in English due to its climate conditions. Despite intermittent dry spells, the area has received about 11 inches of rainfall since I started monitoring it six months ago. Initially, some parts of the land remained moist following heavy rains; however, those areas have dried up over time while new growth continues unabated for me personally marking five years since I began seed sowing activities continuously without any significant break apart from occasional maintenance tasks like creating drip irrigation systems). Lastly, within this period around my birthday last year during late summer/early autumn season prabhakans undertook a tillage operation with datolamb eden equipment resulting in increased soil fertility and enrichment efforts using eye compost application on our fields in preparation for upcoming seasons crops such as dhalimba (a leguminous tree) which is expected to mature by the next rainy season according to our plans aiming for sustainable agriculture practices that include crop diversification and rotational farming techniques over a long term horizon spanning two or more years
