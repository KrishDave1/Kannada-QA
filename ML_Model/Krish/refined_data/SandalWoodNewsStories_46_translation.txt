On August 28th of last year, for my second birthday and as my first plant of the year, I received three to four month-old plants that were already bearing fruit. These plants, named after Pallid, were around six to seven months old at the time. Since then, with careful cultivation and construction of infrastructure such as posts and a post plant within the past year in an area spanning approximately 20 acres (or 600 'kijal', which is roughly equivalent to one million square feet), these plants have thrived despite challenges like dry conditions where only about 11 inches of rainfall has been recorded since my arrivalâ€”a period that marks over half a year. Initially starting with seeds five years ago, I've recently interspersed jasmine among other crops due to their low growth state at present. Last year alone, I took just six steps from outside before beginning this agricultural journey; nowadays Dhalimba trees are approaching very close to our residence during this monsoon season. The goal is to sustainably manage these resources for at least two or three harvests in future seasons while maintaining and improving upon current farming practices.
