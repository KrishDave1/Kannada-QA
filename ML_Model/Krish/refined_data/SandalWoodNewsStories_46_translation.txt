On August 28th of last year, I celebrated my second birthday and introduced a new plant to my collection. These plants, which are now approximately seven months old, were three to four months young when named 'Pallid.' They are thriving and have produced an abundance of fruits on the 20-acre farm where they've been cultivated in an area known as "600 식 kijal," which relies on solar dryers for irrigation. Since my arrival at the farm eleven inches of rainfall have been recorded over six months. The climate has allowed some parts of the crops to remain damp, promoting further growth; indeed, their skins have expanded significantly due to this moisture. I recently installed a drip irrigation system for efficient watering and it seems to be beneficial as the plants continue to flourish without any recent seed plantings—a practice I've followed for five years now. With careful attention and maintenance like installing a drip system, our efforts appear successful: even with occasional challenges such as low soil fertility or excess moisture in certain areas (which was present last year), we managed well enough that neighboring farms like Prabhakarans' Datalambedana took inspiration from our approach during their visits here last season. Now entering the monsoon period again this year, we anticipate continued progress with our dhalimba crop planning for sustained yields over two or three seasons despite potential weather adversities such as heavy rains during this time frame.
