The forest nursery in Karnataka, renowned for its extensive tree cultivation efforts, was established by the speaker in 2011. The establishment phase was initially challenging due to a lack of resources; however, with perseverance and innovative techniques, such as using fish soup bags to nourish the saplings during their first year when milk proved insufficiently nutritious. Located in Terala and utilizing Shivmaga and Chikmaga regions for seed germination, the nursery grows approximately 900 kg of seeds at a time. The process involves soaking seeds in water for 24 hours before treating them with gibberellic acid mixed with alcohol and water solution followed by planting them either directly or after germinating on rocks immersed in this solution for 24-25 days. Afterward, the saplings are transferred to soil where they continue to grow until ready for distributionâ€”typically around June 3rd each year under the Christian Procedure Scheme or similar initiatives wherein farmers receive free plants. The nursery operates primarily within a radius of 80 acres but has expanded up to 160 acres based on demand without compromising quality standards that have positioned it as one of Karnataka's best forest nurseries, impacting thousands of trees planted annually across various parts of India.
