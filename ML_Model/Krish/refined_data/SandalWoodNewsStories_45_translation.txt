The text describes a forest nursery in Karnataka that has been operational since 2011. The founder of the nursery, based in Terala, began the initiative with significant challenges but persevered. The nursery sources its seeds from Shivmaga and Chikmaga regions and grows approximately 900 kg of seeds at a time following a meticulous process: 1. Seeds are soaked in water for 24 hours before being prepared for planting. 2. They are then sown on rocks where they germinate and sprout roots within 16 to 20 days. 3. Once sprouted, the seedlings are moved into soil containers after their outer shell turns brown; this is done over a period of about one month (24 to 25 days). 4. During this phase, seedlings require careful irrigationâ€”a mixture of gibberellic acid dissolved in alcohol and water is used to facilitate growth during the initial stages when planted in soil containers. 5. After planting, seedlings continue to be nurtured with regular watering until they reach maturity for distribution or transplantation elsewhere as saplings by June 3rd each year under the Christian Procedure Scheme initiated locally, which provides these free of cost to farmers adhering to certain conditions like land limits (up to half an acre) or distance restrictions (within 80 km radius). 6. The nursery's efforts have led it to become recognized as one of the best forest nurseries across Karnataka state due bothto its quantity and quality production capabilities despite facing environmental hurdles such as heavy rainfall during critical periods affecting annual operations significantly enough that plantings had needed suspension at times due safety concerns caused by flooding risks associated with saturated grounds post-rainfall events."
