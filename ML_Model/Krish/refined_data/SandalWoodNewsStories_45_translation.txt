The passage describes a visit to an acclaimed forest nursery in Karnataka, India, which was established by the speaker in 2011. Despite initial challenges and lack of fertility issues at the outset, the nursery has flourished under rigorous care and cultivation techniques developed over time. Located in Shivmaga and Chikmaga regions, it maintains strong trees through a meticulous process involving soaking seeds for 24 hours before planting them on rocks and later transplanting them into soil after another period of watering. The nursery grows approximately 900 kg of seeds bi-annually during May and January but also plants additional batches during November and December due to heavy rainfall that typically ceases planting activities until the following year when they resume with their regular cycle starting from March to June. Seeds are distributed on June 3rd as part of a local Christian procedure scheme where farmers receive up to six seedlings per farmer free of cost within specific limits defined by area size (up to half an acre or more) with some restrictions based on distances up to 400 km. The nursery is recognized not just locally but also statewide as one of the best examples in Karnataka for its contributions towards tree cultivation efforts. The success rate is high due to careful selection processes; each sapling grown ensures that a portion of every original tree's DNA remains intact, fostering genetic diversity among new generations of trees nurtured at this facility.
