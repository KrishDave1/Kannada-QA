To refine the text for a BERT-based QA model, I have removed redundancies and non-informative phrases while maintaining the core information. Here is the revised version: The forestry industry in Jogimatti Forest, Chitradurga, has seen growth due to increased awareness and efforts to curb illegal activities following a small number of incidents. The responsible authorities have committed to identifying and holding accountable those responsible for any offences against the forest. Their primary objective is to prevent such actions and safeguard the integrity of the forest ecosystem. This proactive stance by the authorities aims to ensure sustainable management and protection of forests in their jurisdiction.
