 The passage describes the serious issue of illegal activities within the Jogimatti forest in Chitradurga, where a small but concerning number of incidents have occurred. These illicit actions threaten the well-being and integrity of the forest, prompting swift action from local authorities to address these concerns. They are committed to apprehending all perpetrators fully and ceasing any offensive behavior that endangers this vital ecosystem.
