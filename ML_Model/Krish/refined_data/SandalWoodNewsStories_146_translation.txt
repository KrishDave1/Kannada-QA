aud Back to healer It is a parasitic organism, dependent on other hosts for nutrients. However, the 'aud' species can absorb essential nutrients from surrounding trees or weeds. In environments without nearby trees, it utilizes prevalent weed species as a source of sustenance. Our demonstration indicates that planted seedlings can thrive with adequate nutrition provided by these weeds. The setup is designed for non-irrigated conditions; the optimal root depth ranges from one to two feet, which aligns with typical root distributions found in forest settings where weeds have roots half a foot underground. To ensure survival and proper anchoring, the roots should be secured and interlocked within the soil environment. After approximately 18-20 years, these plants will establish permanent roots and contribute to biodiversity through diverse crop yields including agricultural products like oilseeds. This approach promotes agroforestry systems known as food forests—integrating up to 50-60 different plant species per acre—that balance both food production and forest conservation while supporting ecological health and providing wood resources. These systems utilize three distinct varieties of seeds: red-, golden-, and peanut butter-colored types (the latter resembling almonds). For example, tomatoes grown within this system are high yielding – capable of producing upwards of 10 tons when managed correctly – but require careful planning to include both long-term crops that provide sustained nourishment over decades (like those that take five years to mature) alongside shorter term produce for immediate consumption needs of farmers who may eventually retire from active farming after several years of cultivation using only natural pulses derived from seeds sown initially in their fields many years ago. This sustainable practice aims to create an ecosystem conducive to hosting various plant species without reliance on introduced native plants; instead leveraging enriched local soils already present onsite before starting such projects."
