The Kempu moon, commonly known as the blood moon or red sandalwood, is a significant and revered tree in ancient Indian culture and across various Asian countries. It is characterized by its small size, reaching approximately 8 meters in height, with an especially appealing form on its left side. This versatile tree not only serves aesthetic purposes but also plays a crucial role in cultural practices and rituals due to its fragrant essence. Its wood is utilized for making musical instruments owing to both its acoustic properties and spiritual symbolism within the Kulturw Teachings.The optimal conditions for growing Kempu Chandana include well-drained soil rich in stones, particularly suitable for arid environments. In India specifically, this plant thrives when planted with adequate spacing between each sapling (around 4x4 meters) over stone beds about half a meter thick. The ideal planting season is from May to June after the soil has been dried following two years of growth under such conditions. Once established, these trees require minimal maintenance; they can reach up to 150-175 cm tall within three years and produce mature reddish woods which have historically been used medicinally�for instance, treating digestive issues and preventing cancer�as well as being crushed into an aromatic paste mixed with alcohol-based waters traditionally employed for purifying blood via baths or local applications ("Manu Crotophos").
