The Kempu moon, colloquially known as the blood moon or red sandalwood, is a significant and revered tree in ancient Indian culture. This small evergreen tree, growing up to 8 meters with an attractive asymmetrical shape, has numerous applications and cultural significances across Asia. It is renowned not only for its timber but also for its fragrant wood which is used in music instruments and perfumes. The Kempu tree thrives in warm tropical climates and prefers dry conditions; it can be cultivated successfully even within limited spaces of 10 by 10 feet. A mature tree yields approximately 500 kilograms of red sandalwood over a decade-long period after being established—a process that involves initial growth under dry conditions with stone beds from the second to fourth year followed by regular watering from May to June using Manu Crotophos twice a week until April-May when the plant enters fruiting phase where it consumes leaves and stones before reaching full maturity at heights ranging from 150 to 175 cm within three years, growing rapidly up to 6 meters annually thereafter. Historically, this versatile plant has been used medicinally for treating digestive issues and cancerous conditions as well as purifying blood through alcohol extraction. Its importance extends beyond its physical attributes into various aspects of Asian cultures including religious rituals associated with penance (Kulturw Teachings) during evening times (Tárhhavai).
