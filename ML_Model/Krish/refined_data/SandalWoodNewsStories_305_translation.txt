The Sandalwood tree (Srikanth) is a highly valued and fragrant species, renowned internationally for its essential oils and heartwood. In the private market, individual trees fetch between 10 to 15 thousand rupees, with potential earnings from harvest reaching up to 1.2 million rupees per acre when planting 160 trees at a density of approximately 533 trees per acre. This evergreen parasitic shrub depends on other host plants for water and nutrients; preferably leguminous ones like honey locust or gliricidia which are beneficial for its growth due to their ability to stabilize the environment. The ideal conditions involve well-drained soil under rain-fed circumstances as it thrives in environments without excessive irrigation, which could hinder heartwood formation and reduce oil quality.

For optimal development, Srikanth requires scioned hosts planted at distances ranging from 2.5 to 3 meters apart with adequate space allocated for both the host and the Srikanth itself—around five feet distance between each pair of plants ensures proper connection for resource exchange while preventing overcrowding that could stunt growth or lead to disease transmission. The successful cultivation of this species necessitates careful selection of primary hosts, which need to be established first and can range from tea garden sites upwards of two years before introducing secondary hosts like honey trees or glyricidia seedlings that aid in promoting biodiversity within the ecosystem benefiting all parties involved including sandalwood saplings surrounding them after some time has passed (usually around six months). Additionally, diversifying crops such as papaya, lemon, cardamom, cinnamon among others can provide supplementary income sources within the same agricultural area where sandalwood is grown.

To combat theft—a significant challenge faced by sandalwood farmers—the Government of Karnataka supports projects aimed at protecting these precious woods through advanced technological measures such as marking each piece with microchips followed by surveillance systems composed of drones equipped with cameras capable of detecting movements during daylight hours along with servers managed by Indian Wood Science & Technology Institute alerting authorities swiftly upon any unauthorized activity detected towards safeguarding these investments against timber smuggling operations prevalent throughout India's markets today ensuring sustainability while maintaining economic gains associated with one's land investment in high-value forestry ventures
