The tree in question, commonly known as Srikanth or sandalwood, is a highly valued species for its fragrance and valuable heartwood. It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other trees (host plants), deriving water and nutrients from its host rather than the soil. The optimal hosting trees include agroforest species like aranya plants, tea trees, honey trees, and leguminous plants such as glyricidia and sesbania. These hosts not only support the sandalwood but also benefit from the symbiotic relationship by stabilizing their environment and promoting growth. Sandalwood thrives in environments with sufficient sunlight and moderate moisture levels; over-watering can hinder heartwood formation and reduce oil quality. Ideally, host plants should be planted at a distance of 2.5 to 3 meters from young sandalwood saplings to ensure adequate space for development without compromising connectivity to the host for water uptake. Spacing more than 5 feet apart may be necessary once both plants are mature enough to coexist healthily without competition for resources becoming detrimental to either plant's survival or growth potential. For commercial cultivation purposes: - A single hectare can accommodate approximately 160 sandalwood trees when spaced appropriately within an intercropping system that includes papaya, lemon, cardamom, cinnamon et al., potentially yielding upwards of INR 2 crores annually based on market rates per tonne of hardwood (INR 6000/tree). However, initial investment yields around INR 12 lakhs per tree after about 15-20 years given ideal growing conditions free of pests or diseases that could compromise production quantities or qualities. Protection measures against theft are critical due to high demand; hence initiatives like microchipping each tree have been implemented by state governments like Karnataka's "Grow More Sandalwood" project under Indian Wood Science & Technology guidelines which monitor individual tree movements through advanced tracking systems including drones equipped with cameras operating day/night vision capabilities linked directly back to monitoring servers capable of triggering immediate security responses upon detection of unauthorized activities towards protected forestry assets nationwide .
