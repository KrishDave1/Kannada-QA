The Srikanth tree, a hemiparasitic species renowned for its distinctive fragrance and high market value, is an economically important plant fetching around 10 to 15 thousand rupees in the private sector and potentially up to 1.2 million rupees when matured. This evergreen tree thrives under optimal water and food conditions but uniquely relies on another established host tree for its nutrients and water. Its preferred hosts include agroforest trees, aranya plants, tea trees, honey trees (including neem), glyricidia, and sesbania. The Srikanth tree requires a warm, sunny environment with adequate light and moisture; excessive watering can inhibit heartwood formation and reduce oil quality. It should be planted at least 2.5 to 3 meters away from its host due to its leguminous roots which require sufficient space to establish without compromising the connection with the host for shared resources. Optimal spacing ensures effective growth by allowing both the Srikanth tree and its host plant to flourish together within a shared ecosystem that supports biodiversity.

One mature Srikanth tree can yield approximately 20 kg of hardwood worth about half a million rupese per kilogram in today's market ratesâ€”potentially earning upwards of two crores (20 million) from eighty healthy saplings over fifteen years if expertly cultivated under ideal conditions with proper government support through initiatives like 'Grow More Sandalwood.' Additionally, intercropping spaces between these valuable Main Crops (MC) with papaya, lemon crops like cardamom or cinnamon not only diversifies income streams but also acts as biochemical pest control reducing dependency solely on chemical fertilizers/pesticides while enhancing overall farm productivity simultaneously as multicropping models often lead towards sustainable farming practices ensuring positive socio-economic impacts on rural communities & agricultural sustainability goals aligned closely wth Govt policies./
