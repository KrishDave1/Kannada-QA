 The upcoming video will address common questions about building and locating structures, particularly reflecting on the impact of three years of environmental changes in Blackwood. A farmer provides insights into the significant erosion over this period, with sand being depleted to a depth of nearly one foot due to human activity. The discussion delves into sustainable farming practices, as illustrated by Vishwanath Nagar, an agriculturist from Balakot district who manages 11 acres of land. He began his journey with a diploma in agriculture and adopted innovative techniques such as intercropping rice and tea plants within Arunakrishi's Shrikanth and Akare Teek project initiated in 2019. The trees have drained extreme nutrients from the soil, which has led to optimal growth conditions for the past four years. Notably, no additional fertilizers or irrigation water were provided during this time despite minimal leaves on some trees compared to those receiving more attention—a clear indication that consistent care is crucial for healthy plant development.

The conversation highlights the importance of light exposure for aromatic plants like lemongrass (recorded as "bunny" or beehive) and teak (known locally as "host"). These plants thrive under proper lighting conditions, showcasing their robustness over three years without substantial maintenance beyond trimming back excessive foliage once a year to allow sunlight penetration. Vishwanath emphasizes that farmers should focus on quality rather than quantity when it comes to tree management; cutting down hundreds of trees isn't necessary if done correctly with consideration for light accessibility.

Moreover, Vishwanath points out issues related to hosting organic waste disposal pits (referred to as DIP), indicating that improper handling can lead to adverse effects on agricultural lands if not managed annually at planting time alongside essential micro-nutrient provisioning—essential aspects often overlooked by farmers aiming for high production volumes without understanding the delicate balance required for sustainable cultivation practices leading towards long-term success within agroecological settings like Blackwood
