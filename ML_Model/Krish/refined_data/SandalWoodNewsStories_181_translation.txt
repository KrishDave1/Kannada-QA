To refine the text for a BERT-based QA model, I have removed redundant phrases and simplified the language while maintaining all crucial details. Here's the revised version: "When pruning a tree to create an 'air layer,' we selectively remove 50% of its side branches, ensuring that only half of the tree remains. This method allows the remaining portion to continue growing and developing, creating what is known as an air layer or 'kerf.' The process involves cutting approximately one-third of the way through each branch at about 10 feet above ground level. This partial removal enables new growth from within this canopy area without completely defoliating or removing the entire tree. It also facilitates air circulation and light penetration where needed, which contributes to overall plant health."
