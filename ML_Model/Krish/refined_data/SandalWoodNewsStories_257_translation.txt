Red sandalwood, particularly of high quality, is extremely valuable due to its rarity and cultural significance across India's Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kadapa, Chittoor regions as well as in global markets such as China and Japan. The demand for red sandalwood items within these countries has led to a tradition where possessing one is believed to bring good fortune into the home. However, due to rampant illegal smuggling facilitated by dark networks that evade government detection despite strict regulations aimed at preservation and conservation efforts in India under the Indian Forest Act of 1927 (as amended), genuine sale channels like the forest department do exist but come with heavy regulatory oversight. The black market value for red sandalwood can reach upwards of INR 2-3 crores per tonneï¿½a stark contrast that underscores both the environmental concerns surrounding overharvesting and the lucrative nature of this illicit trade.
