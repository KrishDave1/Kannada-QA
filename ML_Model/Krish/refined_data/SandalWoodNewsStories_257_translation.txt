 Red sandalwood, highly valued for its quality and rarity, fetches an exceptionally high price on the international market due to its cultural significance in China, Japan, Myanmar, and other nations. In these countries, owning red sandalwood-made items is considered a symbol of prestige and tradition. India is one of the major sources of this prized wood; it grows abundantly in states like Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka as well as regions such as Kadapa and Chittoor. The illegal smuggling of red sandalwood is rampant in India despite stringent laws by the government because criminal networks sell it at exorbitant ratesâ€”up to 2 to 3 crore rupees per tonne. This illicit trade often evades detection due to complex supply chains leading out of protected forests within the country. Despite efforts from authorities to curb this multi-million dollar industry involving precious timber across borders, enforcement remains challenging amidst strong consumer demand for these luxurious goods worldwide.
