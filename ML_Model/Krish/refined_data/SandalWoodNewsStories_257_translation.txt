 Red sandalwood, highly prized for its quality and grade, is native to various regions within India, notably Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka as well as districts like Kadapa and Chittoor. Due to its exquisite nature, it commands a significant premium in countries such as China and Japan, where it is deeply valued both culturally and economically. The demand for red sandalwood items has become so high that they are perceived as status symbols; thus, owning one can be seen as establishing a good tradition within households across these nations. However, the trade of red sandalwood is marred by illegality in India due to rampant smuggling activitiesâ€”a concern overlooked by law enforcement agencies. The black market value of red sandalwood actualizes at staggering rates: 2-3 crore rupees per ton when sold illicitly through underground networks. While the Forest Department legally sells red sandalwood logs under strict supervision with proper documentation constraints applied equally to domestic buyers or international importers attempting purchases without adherence to regulations.
