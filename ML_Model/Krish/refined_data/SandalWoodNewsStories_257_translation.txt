Red sandalwood, particularly from India, is highly valued for its quality and rarity, making it one of the most expensive varieties globally. Its demand is driven by countries like China and Japan where red sandalwood items are considered symbols of wealth and tradition. The wood's high cost in these nations stems from both its aesthetic value and cultural significance; owning a piece made from red sandalwood is believed to bring good fortune within households. The illegality surrounding the trade of red sandalwood in India arises due to rampant smuggling activities. Despite efforts to curb this through legal channels such as purchasing permits, black market operations persist with reports indicating that smugglers sell upwards of 2-3 crores per ton on the black market. This illegal activity has led to significant conservation concerns for the species, prompting strict regulations under Indian law.
