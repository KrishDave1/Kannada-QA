 The described grill has been in continuous use for approximately 7-8 years, with the proposed height enhancement to ten feet estimated to cost between 8-10 lakh rupees. However, constructing it at a lesser height of around 3-4 lakh rupees alleviates financial concerns while maintaining safety standards. It is also mentioned that this structure could be repurposed as a one-room flat if needed and would likely serve effectively for another eight years before needing replacement or significant upgrades. In terms of longevity and value, investing in high-quality materials and construction for such equipment ensures durability and efficiency over timeâ€”a well-made grill like this could potentially last fifteen years and provide commensurate worth of service equal to its initial substantial investment. Additionally, creating similar quality grills for every household promises consistent performance and satisfaction over their intended lifecycle.
