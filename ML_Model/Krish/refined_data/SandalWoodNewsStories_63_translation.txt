The described grill has been in use for approximately 7-8 years. Constructing it at a height of ten feet would entail an investment of roughly 8-10 lakh rupees, which is within manageable financial limits. The cost to manufacture this specific grill is estimated at 3-4 lakh rupees. Safety measures are paramount; without them, the structure cannot be utilized as intended. A one-room flat built with materials suitable for a grill could serve its purpose for another eight years before requiring replacement or significant renovation due to wear and tear, potentially yielding a value equivalent to INR 10 lakhs over time when properly maintained and used as planned. Investing in high-quality construction ensures longevity and efficiency of the equipment.
