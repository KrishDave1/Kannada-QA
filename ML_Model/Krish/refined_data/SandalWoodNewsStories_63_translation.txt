The described grill has been in service for approximately 7 to 8 years and is essential enough that the speaker suggests it could be constructed at a height of ten feet if they can afford the investment, which would cost between 8 to 10 lakh rupees. However, they assure there's no immediate concern as constructing this grill would only require an investment of about 3 to 4 lakh rupees. The speaker emphasizes that safety measures are non-negotiable; without ensuring safety standards, using or modifying the equipment wouldn't be possible. They also mention future plans: building a one-room flat with a lifecycle of another eight years and then replacing it with yet another robust grill system valued at around 10 lakhs once the new flat is completedâ€”a process expected to maintain their operational needs effectively over time. Additionally, they highlight that producing high-quality one-room flats will lead to sustainable solutions for housing issues while keeping up with their demands over extended periods.
