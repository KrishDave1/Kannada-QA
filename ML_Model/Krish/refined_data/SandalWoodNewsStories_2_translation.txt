This tree species is approximately 50-60 cm in length and is known for its long structure. Its bark starts open, indicating the beginning of heart root development. The seed has already initiated growth, with no additional seed required; you can plant the existing one. For optimal germination placement, position the seed 3 inches from the bottom of a container that should be at least 4 feet deep to accommodate future growth over time. The tree exhibits robust annual growth rates, estimated at an increase of 1.73% each year for up to five years post-germination. This consistent expansion rate suggests healthy heart root formation which continues to improve as the tree matures within its environment.
