 The tree in question measures approximately 50-60 cm in length and is described as nice and long with an open bark. It is capable of germination, and the process has already begun with the development of a heart root from a seed. The presence of a seed within the root confirms that it originated from one. For cultivation purposes, one should plant about 3 inches from the bottom of its 4-feet-long structure. Over the next five years, this species is projected to experience annual growth at a rate of 1.73 percent, indicating consistent expansion each year based on current estimates. This growth trajectory suggests that thanks to its robust heart root formation rates—which are reportedly increasing—the tree will continue to thrive and grow significantly over time.
