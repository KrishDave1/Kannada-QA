The tree in question measures approximately 50-60 cm in length and is described as being long with an open bark, indicating that it's at a stage where the heart root has begun to form. The presence of a seed within the root system confirms that seeds from this tree can be used for germination purposes. For optimal planting, three inches from the bottom of the seed should be placed underground, as the entire section is four feet long. Over the next five years, based on current estimations, this tree is projected to experience annual growth of 1.73 percent; however, it's important to note that this growth rate refers specifically to its incremental increase each year. The initial formation of the heart root appears healthy and shows signs of continued positive development according to these projections.
