 Sri Gandhi, a visionary farmer and agriculturalist from India, embarked on an ambitious journey in 2003-04 to transform his family's farming practices. Located in Chikmangalur district, Tharikeera taluk, he initially built Adikey Thota in 2006 as the foundation for his agrarian innovations. Inspired by the dense forest walls of Malaysia, he recognized the need for sustainable landscaping using sapling walls to prevent soil erosion and enhance biodiversity. Over time, starting with just 4 acres of land, he expanded his cultivable area to 44 acres through careful savings and strategic planning documented within the Freedom App. His commitment paid off handsomely; after constructing a natural Shrikhanda (forest) house on his son's property around 15 years ago without any initial financial assistance from government schemes promised after a decade which eventually provided him with INR 1 lakh plus extra profits amounting to INR 80 thousand due to successful management. Understanding the importance of preserving forests not only for ecological reasons but also for economic gains that can reach upwards of INR 30-50 thousand per kg depending on market conditions — versus transportation costs averaging about INR  1 crore annually—he advocates building one's own forests as a viable investment option that contributes positively towards environmental conservation while potentially yielding substantial returns over traditional forms of agriculture or logging. Recognizing this potential nationwide led him to champion new legislation called "Shrikanth's Law," aimed at streamlining permits and encouraging individuals across India to create similar eco-friendly structures without burdensome taxes like GST or IT department levies post their introduction expected within three to four months following its announcement in the previous budget cycle. Gandhi encourages farmers everywhereto utilize platforms like the Freedom App where they can access detailed guidance on various aspects of agriculture including dam construction techniques used by experts worldwide via codes such as 'VISHU'. He stresses that success stories like his are replicable when coupled with dedication and informed decision-making based on reliable sources such as those available through digital applications designed specifically for empowerment within rural communities..
