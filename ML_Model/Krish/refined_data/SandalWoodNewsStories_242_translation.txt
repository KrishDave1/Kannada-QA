Sri Gandhi, an agricultural entrepreneur from Karnataka, has pioneered several sustainable farming practices and initiatives. His journey began in 2003-04 when he decided to implement agriculture objectives based on his vision for a better future in the field of agriculture. In Chikmangalur district's Tharikeera taluk, he constructed Adikey Thota in 2006, which faced initial challenges due to its location amidst dense forests. In response to these challenges, Gandhi considered building forest walls made of teak wood. However, inspired by a government initiative that promised INR 1 lakh after 10 years for constructing a Shrikhanda house (a traditional farmhouse), he shifted his focus towards this project instead. In 2005, with the intention of passing down these practices to future generations and potentially increasing land value through sustainable development, Gandhi initiated the construction of a Shrikhanda house on his son's property—an endeavor that has since proven profitable over the past decade and half. He expanded his cultivable land from an original four acres to forty-four acres during this period and documented his financial growth as well as conservation strategies within the Freedom App platform he developed. Gandhi emphasizes saving money and investing it back into farming as key components of successful agricultural ventures. He advocates for farmers to understand these principles themselves rather than relying solely on others' guidance or secrets to success. The Freedom App serves as an educational tool where users can learn about various aspects of sustainable agriculture including water management techniques for dams; coconut tree cultivation; manual labor efficiency; and legal processes such as modifying licenses required for certain projects like car manufacturing under new legislation expected within three months following announcements made in India's previous budget (for fiscal year 2021). This upcoming law known as "Shrikanth’s Law" aims to facilitate easier accessibility across India for individuals wishing to build structures without tax implications while also contributing positively toward environmental sustainability by promoting local forestry efforts that benefit both wildlife habitats like bird nests and human communities alike through economic incentives linked directly back into eco-friendly practices at scale if implemented successfully nationwide .
