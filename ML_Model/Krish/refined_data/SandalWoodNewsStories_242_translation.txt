 Sri Gandhi, a visionary agriculturalist and land reformer, has significantly transformed his family's farming practices since the early days of independence. Starting in 2003-04 in Chikmangalur district, Tharikeera taluk, he initiated a series of sustainable agriculture projects culminating in the construction of Adikey Thota in 2006. Inspired by the need for reforestation and influenced by the dense forest walls of Malaysia, he embarked on creating sagwani walls to protect his newly established farmland. In pursuit of further development, he decided to construct a shrikhanda house—a traditional Karnataka dwelling known for its eco-friendly design—on his son's property back in India. This decision was driven by both environmental consciousness and financial incentives; after investing over INR 11 lakhs (USD 15k) over eleven years since starting with just four acres of land, Gandhi has now increased his landholding to nearly 44 acres while turning a net profit exceeding INR 18 lakhs (USD ~24k).

Gandhi is an advocate for self-reliance and empowers farmers through his Freedom App where he shares valuable insights into effective savings strategies and detailed plans for successful implementation. He emphasizes that success requires saving money meticulously rather than seeking shortcuts or external handouts.The app also provides access to government schemes like subsidies for building shrikhanda houses which promise returns within ten years from initial investment along with potential tax benefits once Shrikanth's law is enacted nationally as announced during the previous budget session expected within three to four months post release date. This new legislation could enable anyone across India to legally establish forests without tax burdens while contributing positively towards ecological preservation: ensuring not only significant financial gains but also providing extensive air purification services benefiting local wildlife including birds who will find ample resources thanks to these carefully cultivated environments free from destructive deforestation practices prevalent today due largely unchecked industrial expansion linked closely with urbanization trends worldwide leading us away from harmony between humans & nature alike!
