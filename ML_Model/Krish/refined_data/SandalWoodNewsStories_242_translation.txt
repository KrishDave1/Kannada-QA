Sri Gandhi shares his journey and achievements in agriculture, emphasizing the importance of sustainability and innovation. In 2003-04, inspired by his experiences even before independence, he decided to embark on a path of agrarian development in Chikmangalur district's Tharikeera taluk. He constructed Adikey Tota in 2006, which initially faced destruction due to forest walls. His vision led him to plan for a teak house with an adjacent shrikhanda house (SHG), motivated by government incentives promised for the construction completed between 2011-27 years later. By starting with just 4 acres and expanding it to 44 acres over time, he has not only achieved financial success with profits exceeding INR 1 lakh 80 thousand over the past decade but also demonstrated the significance of saving and investing consistentlyï¿½philosophies he advocates through the Freedom App.The app provides detailed guidance on various agricultural practices like dam building and water management; coconut tree cultivation; and manual labor intensive methods that can yield significant results when implemented diligently. Recognizing the potential impact of Shrikanth's law introduced in India's previous budget, expected to be enacted within three to four months from announcement date, Sri Gandhi highlights its game-changing implications for landowners across India who will soon be empowered to build structures without tax burdens while contributing significantly to GST revenue as well as environmental conservation efforts such as forest expansion which enhances biodiversity and air quality leading upwards towards sustainable living habits encouraged globally but particularly evident through innovations seen locally via apps like Freedom App developed under his mentorship.
