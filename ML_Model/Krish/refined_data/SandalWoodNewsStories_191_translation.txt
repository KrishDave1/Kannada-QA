In the video from Darugru, the speaker provides comprehensive advice on managing mature trees post-harvest. The tree in focus is nine years old and its roots are being extracted; despite this, the tree can still sprout new growth. The video features a tutorial on how to handle such a situation, emphasizing that immediate action is crucial after cutting. The presenter introduces Beltox paste as a solution to prevent fungal infection and ensure cell regrowth. Proper application of this paste around the wound site prevents air from escaping and ensures effective healing.

For efficient protection against pests and rot without chemical treatments or electric fencing, natural methods like carbon sequestration—mixing crushed bark with other crops as soil enrichment—are recommended, especially when using mango as the host plant. This approach contributes to environmental sustainability by returning organic matter to the soil.

The speaker highlights the importance of planning for multi-year cultivation cycles (especially over 8-10 years) and warns against neglect due to time constraints faced by government employees who may not always prioritize agricultural activities due to their responsibilities elsewhere. An estimated 2000 trees were planted eight decades ago but only about 80% remain standing today due to selective felling for various reasons.
