The narrative begins with a personal journey to Tavare Thotta, where the speaker expresses gratitude towards Sundar, a former police officer, and his son for their efforts in conserving sand and constructing a fort-like structure. Sundar's son is noted as Abha Vishwa, who gained recognition for his role in the Kempammana court case. He is described as an impressive artist, having directed a short film titled "Reckoning," which earned acclaim despite the challenges faced during its production. Sanjay Shantaram, known for his performance in "Manne Kempe Gowda," played a significant role in "Reckoning." The speaker recounts advising him on acting techniques after experiencing firsthand what it means to face challenging situations on set. This advice was instrumental in enhancing Sanjay's performance. Vivekanath Bagalkoti, another disciple of the speaker and also a software engineer like Sundar's son Abha Vishwa, is directing a film called "Kushmanda Roopa" wherein he features prominentlyâ€”either as one of the leads or an antagonist. The speaker shares stories related to this project but refrains from disclosing too much due to Sanjay's preference for continuity within narratives. The conversation shifts to discuss Chandanavanna's farmland and how father and son collaborated on creating cement blocks using innovative methods when water scarcity posed challenges. They utilized two motors to facilitate easier access to water resources before addressing issues with stone placement that hindered sand collection by implementing creative solutions such as building 8K blocks instead of purchasing expensive sensors initially intended for monitoring purposes. Over time they successfully constructed around 150 blocks using concrete mixtures among other materials while maintaining space for rainwater absorption essential for protecting livestock areas surrounded by these structures built together like Fort Knox style defense mechanisms against environmental threats (rain). The narrative reflects upon potential career paths available to young talents like Abha Vishwa: continuing with software engineering versus pursuing opportunities within cinema or agriculture sectors based on individual interests and aspirations at various life stages post adolescence but pre-adulthood transition period (around age 15). Notably mentioned are products developed by software engineers such as TV Connect Studio setup initiatives involving acting/dubbing responsibilities personally undertaken by individuals involved; emphas
