In a heartfelt tribute, the narrator expresses gratitude to Sundar, an ex-police officer from Tavare Thotta, and his son for their efforts in preserving sand and constructing a fortified structure on their family land. Sundar's son, Abha Vishwa (Vishveshwara), is celebrated for his role in the Kempapanna case as both an actor and director; he also directed an acclaimed short film titled "Reckoning." The narrative highlights Sanjay Shantaram's performance in the same film and recounts advisory conversations about acting techniques with aspiring actors who possess dance or recording skills. The discussion shifts to another disciple of the narrator, Vivekanath Bagalkoti, who is credited with directing a movie called "Kushmanda Roopa," where he plays a significant character role. Reflecting on past interactions during work on this project over two days, the narrator congratulates Vivekeshwaranah for his progress since adolescenceâ€”from being unaware of farming at 14 years old to now contributing significantly to its success at age 15 by focusing on sustainable practices such as creating permeable spaces between blocks for water retention while building cement structures. An exploration of career choices follows: should Vivesheswara continue with software engineering after developing products like TV Connect or pursue cinema? The conversation acknowledges challenges faced by professionals balancing personal commitments with full-time jobs that require weekend dedication despite potential distance from city centers. It emphasizes the importance of community engagement through game development and environmental consciousness within testing facilities like Sand Fort Ground Zero (SandFTG). Finally, expressions of admiration abound: praising young artists like Udda Bhandari (Uday), standing at six feet tall as a remarkable artist with exceptional talent across singing domains including base voice capabilities; Chandanadurga Mananda seems particularly proud of these accomplishments among others mentioned earlier, reiterating trust in these individuals' passion benefiting not only them but also enriching society around them. This post serves as both recognition of individual achievements within certain projects dominated by legal dramas ("Kempapanna") and cinematic endeavors ("Reckoning"/"Kushmanda Roopa"), coupled with advice for future paths in either software engineering or entertainment industries while maintaining respect towards traditional agriculture practices.
