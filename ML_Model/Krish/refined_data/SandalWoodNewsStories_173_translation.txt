22-year-old Ajay, a young farmer from Yadagiri, shares his journey and experiences in agriculture. Despite completing an IT course and initially struggling to find the right path for earning, Ajay found his calling in farming. With 18 acres of land at his disposal, he has been cultivating crops for five years, taking full responsibility for the family's income. Ajay discovered the Freedom App early on and subscribed to a three-year premium plan after seeing its potential benefits. He utilized the app by watching various courses that included Dragon Fruit Cultivation using Paper Plate Cups, Sree Gandha Dho Bagina (SGB), and Dalimbe techniques. These courses provided him with valuable insights into efficient water usage based on soil types like Kampman which retain less water due to their attractiveness as camping sites. Ajay plans to continue learning through agricultural education over the next four and a half years before fully investing in Srikanth crop cultivation around seven years from now. His goal is to optimize irrigation practices without causing excessive moisture issues in his fieldsâ€”a testament to his commitment to sustainable farming methods influenced by Kavitha Mishra's educational content on the Freedom App platform where he studied extensively before planting 4 acres dedicated solely to Srikanth crops among other ventures like paper plates production which he aims start within two years post-Corona pandemic impact assessment . The Freedom App serves as an educational tool for farmers who seek knowledge beyond traditional means; it empowers them with information about profitability versus losses faced daily by modern agriculturists who must balance farm management with personal wellbeing amidst challenges such as market fluctuations affecting both profits and sustainability efforts needed today more than ever before accordingtoajovarfarmer #FarmEducation #YoungFarmers #InnovativeAgriPractices #EmpowermentThroughKnowledge
