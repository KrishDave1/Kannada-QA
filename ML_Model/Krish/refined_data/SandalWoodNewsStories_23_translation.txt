Ramesh Balutagi, a long-time Christian from Kushtagi, Koppal district, has been recognized for his dedication and efforts in the field of sandalwood farming. His journey began early in life with his engagement at Sririvantanagu under the mentorship of Sririvandha, where he learned the intricacies of cultivating this precious resource. Ramesh's commitment to enhancing productivity led him to establish a significant Sririvandha Parimala Hub on 1500 acres of land in Kushtagi. His hard work and innovative practices have not only earned him respect but also provided employment opportunities for over 250 youths who are now part of an industry that teaches them how to sustain themselves through wood-based agriculture as highlighted by Sivarna News. The Gandhada Naadanna initiative is central to Ramesh's achievements making it a source of pride for both him and his community within the bustling city center known as Kanna Haus amidst thriving Sririvandha farms.
