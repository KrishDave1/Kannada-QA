Ramesh Balutagi, a devout Christian from Kushtagi, Koppal district, has been recognized for his significant contribution to the region's economy through his endeavor, Gandhada Gudiya Gandugali. Despite his humble beginnings and long spiritual journey that included converting to Christianity and dedicating himself to Sririvantanagu under the tutelage of Sririvandha, Ramesh has achieved remarkable success with the establishment of a large-scale operation called Sririvandha Parimala Hub situated on 1500 acres in Kushtagi. This hub employs over 250 young individuals who learn sustainable wood-based farming practices from him. Ramesh's efforts have not only created employment opportunities but also serve as an inspiration for many by demonstrating how one can build a prosperous life around forest products at Gandhada Naadanna Belaguâ€”a venture that stands out proudly within Sivarna News reports and contributes significantly to both local livelihoods and renown.
