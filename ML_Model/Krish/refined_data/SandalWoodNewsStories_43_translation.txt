In a comprehensive interview in Bangalore, Ananth Padmanabhan, known as the 'father of Sandalwood,' provided insights into the current state and future prospects of this valuable resource. Historically, India produced around 4,000 to 5,000 tonnes of sandalwood annually; however, due to increased rarity and poaching incidents, the output has drastically reduced to mere hundreds of tonnes. Currently referred to as 'Durghandagudi' (hard-to-find sandalwood), it is estimated that Karnataka alone requires approximately 20 to 80 tonnes for its needs but receives only over 20 tonnes nationally—with oil being prioritized for internal use rather than export.

Padmanabhan highlighted that despite reports suggesting significant losses due to illegal harvesting across various states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, these claims are unfounded as forest departments report minimal loss. He emphasized the need for private industry participation in cultivating sandalwood since demand exceeds supply from wild sources. Privately owned land can be utilized for sustainable farming with proper permissions now granted under amended forest policies in several regions like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu after an initial ban on cultivation was lifted following policy reforms aimed at promoting responsible growth practices while ensuring rights over cultivated plants through certification from authorities such as the Forest Department when conducting agricultural studies comparable across different lands which could revolutionize crop management strategies globally if applied universally within agriculture sectors concerned with endangered species conservation efforts alongside economic viability concerns .

The Karnataka government supports these initiatives but notes there may be variations in rules between states since forestry policy falls under state jurisdiction; still, both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu share similar regulatory frameworks concerning sandalwood cultivation. Furthermore discussions on seed procurement revealed that old beliefs about directly planting seeds collected from trees should be discarded because they originated from trees not yet reproductively mature enough—instead favoring seeds harvested during periods when trees produce flowers suitable for pollination resulting in high germination rates months later when planted correctly in nurseries where upwards of 1 kilogram of seeds yields around 5 thousand viable ones , though half typically germinate successfully upon planting outdoors utilizing proper irrigation techniques helping prevent soil borne diseases such as Fusarium or Pythium infestations
