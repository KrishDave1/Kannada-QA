The rarest of rare figure in Sandalwood, Ananth Padmanabhan, discusses the critical decline and conservation efforts for this precious resource in Karnataka. Historically, India produced around 4,000 to 5,000 tonnes of sandalwood; however, current production has plummeted to less than 20 tonnes due to overharvesting and illegal trade. This scarcity extends beyond just wood—even sandalwood oil is scarce because states like Karnataka retain most of it for local use and do not sell it externally. Padmanabhan highlights that the demand for sandalwood exceeds natural supply levels, necessitating private cultivation to support industry needs. He notes that while forest policies previously restricted private growth of sandalwood without permisson, recent amendments allow anyone to cultivate it provided they adhere to certain regulations designed by the forest department. Private landowners who have obtained certificates from the forest department can legally grow sandalwood and contribute valuable insights into agricultural practices that could benefit wider cultivation initiatives. Research on optimal land usage for sustainable growth is ongoing under government guidance. Karnataka leads with supportive policies alongside Tamil Nadu; both states have similar rules regarding sandalwood cultivation as a state subject with autonomous regulation-making authority within their jurisdictions. There's an emphasis on using reproductively mature trees (when they begin blooming) rather than waiting upwards of 22 years from seed planting before harvesting timber-sized plants or collecting seeds for nurseries every four or five years as per Oxford dictionary's Time Limit Acronym (TLA). The discussion also addresses concerns about seed quality: larger seeds are often assumed superior but studies indicate otherwise—smaller seeds can yield equally good results after proper treatment and care in nurseries where approximately 5 kilograms yield between 5 thousand to 5.5 thousand viable seeds with a germination rate averaging around half once planted in ideal conditions free from diseases such as Fusarium oxysporum fsp albedinis (Fusarium), Pythium spp., and Nematodes which can be managed through effective disease control measures implemented during cultivation processes at these nurseries
