In a detailed interview set against the backdrop of Bangalore, the conversation focused on Sandalwood—a precious commodity increasingly scarce in India, once sourcing up to 4,000 to 5,000 tonnes annually but now struggling to meet even 20 tonnes due to rampant illegal harvesting and smuggling. The interviewed expert, Ananth Padmanabhan, known as the "father of Sandalwood," emphasized that while forest departments across states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have not reported significant losses of sandalwood trees within their jurisdictions, there is an alarming demand-supply gap. To address this issue, private cultivation is essential; it's encouraged by recent policy changes allowing individuals and farmers to grow sandalwood without needing special permissions. However, despite these reforms, there are still challenges with implementation. For instance, while anyone can plant sandalwood saplings after receiving certification from the Forest Department (which ensures responsible cultivation), actual care for mature trees requires official involvement or authorization from local authorities—a process sometimes criticized for being cumbersome.

The discussion also delved into botanical specifics such as seed selection and propagation methods. Traditional practices involving replanting tree seeds during bloom were questioned in favor of collecting seeds ready for germination few years post-pollination based on research indicating reproductive maturity at this stage according to Oxford dictionary terminology ("TLA" – Tree Let akely After Pollination). Seeds obtained through nurseries are crucial; roughly 5-6 thousand seeds weigh per kilogram with a guaranteed fifty percent germination rate when properly nurtured using seedbed treatment post planting. Challenges persist with fungal diseases like Fusarium wilt and Pythium root rot affecting seedling health amidst nematode infestations; however best agricultural practices aimed at disease control provide hope for sustainable production growth in line with regulatory support provided by state governments like those in Karnataka which actively advocate for such initiatives within their respective forests policies alongside national guidelines ensuring fair trade between urban users who consume products derived from these precious trees and rural producers who work tirelessly towards meeting market demands sustainably.'
