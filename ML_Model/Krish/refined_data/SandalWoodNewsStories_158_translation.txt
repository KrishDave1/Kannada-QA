Raju, originally from Shikarapuram, Shimakazh, has been managing a nursery for 12 years. He planted his first nursery as a child and later expanded to include a forest nursery of 20 acres over 11 years. Additionally, he cultivated another 12 acres of sandalwood over the past 3-4 years. His operation aims to harvest mature sandalwood trees after approximately 20 years, with expectations of earning Rs.2 lakhs per acre upon maturity. The Indian government amended the forest laws in 2002 allowing private individuals to plant sikandana (Sandalwood). Following this policy change, farmers across regions like Kuala Lara, Chinthamani, and Chikbalapura began growing sikandana on a large scale in Karnataka's fertile lands. The farmers anticipate that their investment will yield significant returns within 20 years but are optimistic about the potential profit ranging from Rs.60-300 crores based on market trends and future demand assessments for sikandana wood internationally. Raju explained that optimal plantation times vary; typically, saplings are grown for around 15 years before being transplanted into larger plots where they can reach full size under favorable conditions such as good soil quality and adequate rainfall support if needed during initial growth stages until established enough not to require supplementary irrigation anymoreâ€”around year eighteen or nineteen post-transplanting when they should no longer need watering according to expert advice aimed at ensuring healthy plant development without causing undue stress due to drought conditions or other environmental factors impacting heart health negatively over time..
