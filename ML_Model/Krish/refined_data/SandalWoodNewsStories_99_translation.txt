 Aathaa, formerly known as Vishu Kumar, transformed her life into agriculture after witnessing the miraculous birth of Sri Gandhada in Chikka Mangaluru. Her journey gained national and international recognition following a report by TV9 about the extraordinary nature of Sri Gandhada's birthday, which further sparked interest in Lalana Pallan. As her reputation grew within India, she became an esteemed figure globally; notably celebrated in Africa where she educated others on sustainable farming practices inspired by Sri Gandhada's teachings. The African visitors gifted seeds to Vishu Kumar for trial cultivation with assurances of support if needed—a gesture that exemplified cross-cultural collaboration in agriculture. Vishu Kumar's influence extends beyond borders as both Malawi's government and the Lalana administration have invited her for agricultural exchange programs due to her exceptional contribution to farming methods revitalized through contact with Sri Gandhada’s philosophy and techniques. Now revered as 'Mother to Everyone,' Aathaa advocates for more shared knowledge between farmers worldwide, especially urging Indian officials and fellow agriculturists like those led by Sri Gandhada to facilitate such exchanges so that visionaries like herself can continue uplifting local communities while also promoting their rich heritage internationally. Through this transformation from a millionaire businesswoman to a passionate farmer educator who serves humanity across continents, Aathaa stands as an inspiring example of personal growth interwoven with global humanitarianism grounded deeply in agrarian wisdom passed down via Guruji (Sri Chandradatta).
