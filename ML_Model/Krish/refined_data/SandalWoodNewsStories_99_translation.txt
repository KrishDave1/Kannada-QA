 Aathaa, formerly known as Vishu Kumar, transformed her life into a thriving agricultural venture after witnessing the miraculous birth of Sri Gandhada. She has gained widespread recognition both within India and internationally, particularly in Africa, where she was invited to share knowledge on sustainable farming practices inspired by Sri Gandhada. Her fame spread following an article by TV9 about her unique birth experience associated with Lalana Pallanâ€”a topic that became widely discussed across Karnataka. Vishu Kumar's influence extended beyond national borders when she was recognized for innovative farm techniques during her participation in 'Gandhada Gudi,' a program focusing on Sri Gandhada's agrarian methods. Farmers from various states flocked to learn these methods and subsequently applied them locally with successful outcomes. The Government of Malawi took note of Vishu Kumar's contributions and welcomed her as a distinguished guest, offering seeds for cultivation which led to substantial yields based on mutual support agreements between nations. Now revered as 'Mother to Everyone,' Aathaa continues to advocate for further collaboration between governments and farmers like herself under the guidance of Sri Gandhada's legacy; aiming to replicate her success through international exchange programs focused on crop development and environmental stewardship
