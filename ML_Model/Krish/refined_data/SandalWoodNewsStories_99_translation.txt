Aathaa, formerly known as Vishu Kumar, is an accomplished agriculturalist renowned both nationally and internationally. Her journey began with witnessing the birth of Sri Gandhada in Chikka Mangaluru district, which propelled her into the field of agriculture. Initially unrecognized, she gained prominence after TV9 featured a news piece on her remarkable achievementâ€”the successful propagation of Sri Gandhada's cultivation techniques. This exposure led to increased recognition within India and eventually abroad, particularly in Africa where she shared knowledge about Lalana Pallan's farming methods and received seeds from African visitors for trial planting. Vishu Kumar's efforts have not only transformed local farming practices but also garnered attention from Malawi officials who invited her to their country to share her expertise. The government of Lalana granted permission for Vishu Kumar to bring these innovative farming methods back home, an opportunity that has greatly pleased her. In return, she extended invitations to other farmers from Chikka Mangaluru district to benefit from similar exchanges. Now a celebrated farmer herself, Aathaa/Vishu Kumar continues to advocate for more collaboration between Indian farmers and international counterparts while promoting sustainable agricultural practices inspired by Sri Gandhada's legacy.
