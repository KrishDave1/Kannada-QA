Summary for BERT-based QA Model: The text discusses the Sri Gandha tree, a hemiroot parasitic species that develops heartwood with excellent properties suitable for medical and aesthetic purposes. The tree is cultivated in nurseries, particularly in Sashi Palanalai near Aruniyalaki, where over 6 lakh trees have been grown this year. Demand for these trees is high, prompting plans to increase production to 10 lakh trees next year. A call from Nagraj of Pawgad explores the suitability of growing Sri Gandha trees in Sriganmura, with considerations for soil types such as Lomi soils and adaptability to various conditions including clay and sandy soils. Conservation projects are initiated using host plants like Hongunna Soap and Khajurina, along with organic practices like compost coconut application. Fertilization is minimal; a seed suffices due to the plant's robust nature. Intercropping with other plants like Hebbia or Dhanimbe is encouraged as they serve as good hosts alongside weeds and stones which can also support the growth of Sri Gandha. Regarding regulations on harvesting Sandalwood (Srikantha), which was historically considered government property but can now be privately owned after maturation, there are no restrictions on its removal from natural habitats provided it remains within original sites where growth conditions are optimal due to moisture and sunlight availability in places like Vanabheshaya or forested areas. Water usage varies depending on locationâ€”irrigation may not be necessary in regions receiving adequate natural moisture or sunlight exposure during dry seasons but could be beneficial during rainy periods when additional water might facilitate better growth conditions prior to harvesting after approximately 15 years when hotwood formation peaks leading up to maximum yield around age 20-30 years old., There are ongoing efforts led by local governments and organizations such as Kaisur Siddhi Foundation Ltd., working closely with farmers towards sustainable agricultural practices including soil enrichment through social initiatives aimed at improving land quality while supporting local economies through increased production of valuable timber species like Sri Gandha/Srikantha
