 The narrative delves into the construction of a new building in a garden setting and its connection to the blood moon phenomenon. The speaker recounts their experience in Srikanth, where they operated a facility with 100-200 beds, and their fascination with the blood moon, which was anticipated across China, Mongolia, Japan, Nepal, Burma (Myanmar), and India. This particular blood moon was associated with superstitions and rituals; it was believed that presenting such a Moon before deities could invoke divine favor or punishment. The speaker explains that after four years since witnessing this celestial event during Pushpa's movie premiere night ('Pushpa Put Chatu Mukkabaaz'), they have cultivated a tree known as 'Sri Gandhi Blood Moon.' This tree is not only valued for its aesthetic qualities but also for its medicinal properties used in beauty products. Despite being subject to government regulations regarding harvesting, the tree grows rapidly—up to 30 feet within three years—and exhibits striking red hues as it matures toward full dryness. Maintenance involves allowing natural processes to occur without excessive intervention or watering; however, adequate irrigation is crucial due to transpiration from deep root systems. The conversation shifts towards agricultural aspects: balancing market demands against environmental sustainability while addressing soil moisture concerns using techniques like drip irrigation on groundwater-dependent ecosystems. There's an emphasis on Sri Gandhi Blood Moon trees as commercial crops grown chiefly for housing materials rather than personal consumption. The dialogue touches upon efforts by Tamil Nadu residents supported by Kannada individuals via YouTube channels aiming to disseminate valuable agricultural information nationally while alleviating misinformation through educational content creation about crop management practices effectively communicated through video tutorials targeting both farmers and consumers alike interested in sustainable farming methods aligned with government policies promoting healthful initiatives like blood donation camps deemed beneficial due partly to successful case studies involving Purushottam Reddy's contributions at Srikantak CBN Ltd., who champions both commerce and ecological preservation himself described as "a fan of greenery." Ultimately, embracing green spaces is proposed over purely commercial pursuits while considering market dynamics responsibly within legal frameworks set forth by authorities involved regulating these matters (CBN - Chemicals & Bulk Drugs).
