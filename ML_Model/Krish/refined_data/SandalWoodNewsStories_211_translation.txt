17-year-old Rekha has recently arrived in a new region where she intends to live for another seven years, working on public illustrations while pursuing her passion for photography with the goal of capturing 3200 photos over the next six years. She has been in this place for an extended period, approximately half a decade, and during her time there, she recalls having fed sheep prior to shifting her focus onto these creative endeavors. Her presence is part of fulfilling her wife's dream. However, their home sustained significant damage due to severe storms which struck overnight; initially damaging more than 84 houses but ultimately leading to total destruction of 24 homes. The extent of the damage is estimated at between INR 90 lakhs (9 million) and INR 1 crore (INR 10 million). Remarkably, despite such adversity that even led to disruptions in sales from clients like the district Dean Surga who subsequently intervened on behalf of Rekha—a government employee dedicated to serving citizens for nearly three decades without ever receiving any monetary compensation or regulatory authorization before now—she remains undeterred and committed both personally and professionally towards protecting people's rights within her role as a civil servant.
