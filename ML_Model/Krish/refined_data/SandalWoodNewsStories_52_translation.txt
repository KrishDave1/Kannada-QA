 In a detailed video uploaded daily at 9 am, Dr. P.K. Praveen Babu, an esteemed scholar and philosopher in Ayurveda and Marama, discusses the significance of Shrikandhaâ€”an herb revered with high religious status in Indian pooja rituals due to its association with a life lived in the forest as per Lord Vishnu's blessings. Born in Heralavai (now Virala) years ago in Karnataka, Shrikandha is more than just a medicinal plant; it embodies Sita-Virya-Dravya attributes that bestow vigor and robust health when utilized properly through aromatic applications rather than topical ointments or chemically derived treatments. The discussion also highlights the effectiveness of Shrikandha oil produced only at Erstmal for treating skin conditions and injuries without adverse effects as seen with conventional methods focused on cardio irrigation or detoxification processes like Purvakarma for skin diseases according to Ayurvedic practices known as Panchakarma therapy. Dr. Babu encourages viewers to subscribe to their channel for regular yoga videos, ring the bell icon for notifications, like, share, and namaste them farewell while emphasizing the importance of integrating traditional knowledge into modern wellness routines by preserving trees dedicated to "Sri Kanda."
