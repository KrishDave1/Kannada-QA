Dr. P.K. Praveen Babu, an Ayurveda and Marama scholar and philosopher, introduces the topic of Shrikandha in his daily video series available on his channel at 9 am every day. Born in Karnataka during the era of Heralavai (now known as Virala), Shrikandha holds a significant religious status particularly in Pooja rituals due to its association with sanctity attributed by divine figures for living in forestsâ€”reflecting qualities of serenity and robustness. Dr. Babu emphasizes that before using Shrikandha medicinally, one must understand its inherent characteristics which are distinct from other 'Shita-Virya-Dravyas'. He explains that applying substances with the essence or fragrance similar to genuine Shrikandha can embody these beneficial properties essential for human health, especially skin conditions where traditional chemical treatments fall short; he advocates specifically for natural oils prepared from Shirkanth wood shavings to address such issues effectively without adverse side effects while promoting sustainability through cultivation practices endorsed by their team's experiences.
