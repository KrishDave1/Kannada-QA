The following refined text provides a clear and concise summary of the key details for a BERT-based QA model, focusing on the context surrounding the Andhra stone game in Srikanth, its history, and the involvement of a local oil extraction company named Awali: Situated 30 km from Maduguli and near Rollanwallailli in Andhra Pradesh, Srikanth has become synonymous with an intricate stone game that is part of its cultural fabric. For over a decade, individuals living in Srikanth have been engaged in this traditional craft. The future of these artisans appears uncertain as they seek stability amidst challenges posed by their livelihood. A private company called Awali operates nearby; it specializes solely in oil extraction without engaging in any other form of production within Srikanth itself. Despite this separation between industries, there seems to be some interconnection between Awali's operations and the local stone carving industry due to resource sharing or economic ties. Additionally, Awali exports its extracted oils globally after processing them into various products at their facility. Approximately half of their production activities take place locally around Salmori village where only one other company exists alongside itâ€”a testament to how significant both entities are within this region's economy. There is suspicion among locals about potential collaborations between these two businesses which could influence regional dynamics further. The value placed on individual pieces produced by those skilled in the artistry found within Rollaimba remains high when considering offers such as 2000 kg for seagull sculptures made from stones sourced from Srikanth trees linked to this ancient trade traditionally passed down through generations herein known as "seacow."
