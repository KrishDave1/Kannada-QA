ðŸŒ± **Daru Group's Sringada Garden Overview:** Located in a secluded area, Daru Group's Sringada garden is a 3-acre plot that was developed and planted within a year. The garden was previously used for sugarcane cultivation and has been transformed into a diverse agricultural space. A series of three videos documenting the journey from planting to harvest after six months have been released by the group. One year post-planting, the results are evident, with significant growth achieved using intercropping methods, including G Vilas and Srikandha varieties. The garden benefits from strategic planning that took advantage of natural topographyâ€”identifying low points to manage water flow effectively. Drip irrigation systems were installed along with carefully planned planting directions to optimize yield potential. Since its establishment, the garden has successfully grown coriander as an interim crop, demonstrating quick yields and profitability based on feedback provided by Anish (a team member). Srikandha plants have flourished within this setting; they have shown rapid growth and maturity rates due to careful selection of mother plants for nurseries at Daru Group's farm facilities in Belgaum district, near Hidikkal village. These efforts resulted in uniformly growing plants weighing over 400 grams eachâ€”evidence of successful farming practices led by experts with extensive experience (over 15 years) and knowledge (8 years). The cost associated with these services pales in comparison to the long-term benefits reaped from adopting their guidance for developing similar gardens elsewhere.
