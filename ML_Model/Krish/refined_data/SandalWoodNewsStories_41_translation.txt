Five villagers in Beter district's Aura taluk have embarked on a project to cultivate and propagate the sacred Sri Gandha trees, which had been standing for approximately 10-15 years. These farmers aim to establish a new generation of these trees by planting them in land where the original ones grew. The initiative involves transferring mature Sri Gandha trees into a forest setting. Despite their efforts over 13 years, the farmers lack adequate security measures and marketing knowledge, leading to significant wastage of resources and time. The process begins with harvesting mature Sri Gandha trees, each weighing between 16-18 kg after reaching maturity. Once uprooted, these trees are transported at night using machinery to avoid spreading any potential odor from the forest that could harm nearby crops or affect wildlife habitats (as per Suresh Nayak's report on TV9 Bidar). The goal is to replant these saplings in an adjacent forest area sustainably managed by local authorities who ensure environmental protection during this operation. However, challenges remain as some farmers struggle with issues such as tree survival rates post-transplantation due partly to insufficient support systems like irrigation facilities within the newly designated forests areas they are tasked with maintaining responsibly under police supervision for conservation purposes without causing adverse effects on surrounding ecosystems or communities dependent upon them for livelihood sources like agriculture etc., thus highlighting broader concerns regarding sustainable development practices balancing ecological preservation alongside human welfare needs especially when traditional farming techniques meet modern conservation goals
