Farmers in Beter district's Aura taluk have embarked on a decade-long journey to cultivate and nurture the trees of Sri Gandha, which had been growing for about 10-15 years. With the intention to propagate this species, they planted approximately 16-18 kg of seeds over the land, hoping to establish a new generation of these trees in the forest. Despite their efforts and dedicationï¿½working day and night with machinery to tend to the saplings the farmers face challenges such as lack of marketing knowledge and security concerns after thirteen years without significant returns. The trees are now maturing into stone fruit varieties like Siwalik Almond (Sri Gandha), but some issues persist; namely, protecting against theft and ensuring sustainable growth practices within ecological constraints. Suresh Nayak from TV 9 Bidar reports on these struggles faced by local inhabitants whose livelihood depends on successful orchard maintenance, while also highlighting law enforcement's role in preventing illegal logging that could further jeopardize agricultural sustainability.
