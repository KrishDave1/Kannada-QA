 A group of five villagers from Beter district's Aura taluk have undertaken a significant project to cultivate and replenish the sacred trees of Sri Gandha, which had been standing for approximately 10-15 years. These hardworking farmers are transitioning to a new generation of these trees within lands where they were initially planted. Despite planting over 272 kg (minimum) of seeds, after 13 years, they face challenges due to lack of security and marketing know-howâ€”resulting in what seems like wasted effort thus far. The process involves nighttime excursions into the forest with machinery to nurture the saplings until they can be successfully transplanted back into the soil where they belong. The endeavor is fraught with difficulties; there are concerns about preserving the natural state of forests against encroachment by those exploiting them for economic gain and ensuring that wildlife remains unaffected by human interference or deterioration in air quality due to tree felling activities. Suresh Nayak reports on this delicate balancing act between sustainable agriculture and ecological conservation (TV9, Bidar).
