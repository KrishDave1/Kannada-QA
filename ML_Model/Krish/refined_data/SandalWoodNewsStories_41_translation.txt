In the Beter district of Karnataka, particularly in Aura taluk, five diligent farmers have embarked on a mission to cultivate and propagate the sacred Sri Gandha trees, which had matured over 10-15 years. These pioneering agriculturists are nurturing a new generation of these trees on land where they were initially planted. Despite their efforts, the farmers face challenges such as insufficient knowledge in marketing and an absence of security measures after thirteen years of dedication with no tangible results. The initial planting involved at least 16-18 kg of seeds per hectare, yet due to a lack of expertise in translocation techniques, many saplings turned into stoneâ€”a phenomenon that poses significant obstacles to forestation efforts. Undeterred by setbacks like this and plagued by issues such as wildlife interference at night leading to tree felling or damage when machines assist them during reforestation attempts under moonlight nights (to mimic natural sunlight), these resilient individuals continue their quest for successful growth despite facing legal hurdles from conservation laws that prevent indiscriminate logging but also restrict sustainable practices necessary for improving forest cover around Bijapur districts like Bidar's Aura taluk as reported by Suresh Nayak from TV 9 News channel based out there..
