The state of Karnataka, particularly the region of Sri Gandhada Bedu in Kolar district, has witnessed significant agricultural advancements with farmers like Gopalakrishna pioneering the cultivation of new crops. These young and inspiring farmers, including those from Gandhada Nadu, have transitioned from traditional methods to modern farming techniques on both government-encouraged and privately owned land. In Bailusime village, a 6-year-old farm established by Gopalakrishna covers approximately 12 acres planted with Faravalambi trees that require irrigation for two years through drip systems due to their high water demands during initial growth phases. The pruning process is crucial for maintaining tree health; surprisingly, they only remove three feet from the bottom part to promote robust growth over time.Gopalakrishna emphasizes the importance of soil quality and its impact on crop succession; it may take upwards of 20 years before optimal results are seen after planting new varieties of soil or seeds such as flour, tomatoes, beans, papaya among others. He advocates for government assistance in protecting these valuable trees against potential threats like pests and disease which could otherwise render them useless or cause widespread destruction if not properly cared for post establishment period (around 8-9 years). Additionally., he points out existing subsidies offered by factories like Maratha Soap Factory in Mysore/Bengaluru that provide financial incentives to local farmers once they begin producing 'smelly crops,' which are actually profitable despite low market rates when compared to other crops like tomatoes where prices fluctuate significantly.
The smelly crop initiative has been legalized and supported by both the forest department and national programs such as National Ayehs Mission under Horticulture Department allowing farmers unrestricted access to grow these lucrative crops on their own land without any bureaucratic hurdles involved previously ï¿½ contrasting starkly with earlier situations where farmer registration was mandatory but often ignored leading to complications later down the line unless proper records were maintained via platforms provided by the government's Fruits Haseeru scheme or similar portals issuing work orders directly linkedto seedling deposits into farmer accounts simplifying funding availabilityProcesses related topayment verification are streamlined across various departments ensuring easeofaccessfarms receive necessary support within days upon application rather than weeks spent navigating complex administrative
