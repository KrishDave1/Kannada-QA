To refine the provided text for a BERT-based QA model, I have removed redundant information, irrelevant details, and non-informative content while retaining key facts and statistics. Here is the revised text: The state of Karnataka, particularly Sri Gandhada Nadu within it, has seen an increase in innovative farming practices. Farmers like Gopalakrishna from Kolar district have been pioneering these methods by growing new crops such as Sri Gandha on 12 acres of land. These farmers are facing challenges with water scarcity; hence they rely on drip irrigation to sustain their gardens that are around 6 years old with approximately 2000 trees each. Gopalakrishna's farm is one example where he has planted Faravalambi trees alongside Sri Gandha to address water needs. He prunes the trees every six years to promote growth and has taken measures to improve soil quality over time. The government encourages such sustainable practices through programs like National Ayyappa Mission under the Horticulture Department which legalizes the harvesting of smelly crops (also known as medicinal plants) on farmers' lands since 2001 after its legalization by the government. This initiative covers about 1000 acres across various regions and provides support to farmers who engage in this type of cultivation, contributing significantly to rural development and economic recovery efforts in India over recent years. Since its introduction three years ago, this program has resulted in substantial improvements for local communities involved in these agricultural activities without compromising environmental conservation efforts or traditional farming techniques used by generations before us." Key points include: - Introduction of diverse crop cultivation initiatives led by young farmers inspired by peers like Gandhada Bedu's approach towards agriculture innovation within Sri Gandhada Nadu region of Karnataka state, India. - Water management strategies employed using drip irrigation systems due to scarce water resources available for large scale gardening projects undertaken at individual farms spread across small villages such as Bailusime near Kolar district township center survey no.-59 plot size measuring upwards from half an acre including Gopalakrishna's successful case study involving mixed plantations including both fruit bearing varieties (Sri Gandha & Faravalambi). - Government assistance through programs aimed at promoting sustainable horticultural practices via financial aid total
