You have experience in agriculture, having established a farm on your uncle's land and subsequently on your brother's property. Your agricultural journey includes experimenting with various crops and trees, such as planting a tree 7 years ago and observing its growth. You've noticed that certain regions around Mysore, including Chamaraja Nagar and Kollegal/Chikkaballapur, particularly Srikantanagar, are favorable for farming due to their high oil content and sanitation levels. These areas are ideal for farmers to focus on cash crops like corn or other high-value produce. The cultivation of corn requires about 3 years before it can yield significantly, after which it can be followed by rice cultivation using a tractor for another 3 years cycle. The type of soil—whether red or black—does not greatly affect the success of these crops; however, the oil content tends to be higher in red loamy soils with fewer stones. Security is also a concern; large-scale operations require proper fencing to deter theft or damage from wildlife like wild boars (referred to as "white ants" in the text). High-density planting (600-700 trees per hectare) is recommended over smaller scales because managing hundreds of trees requires substantial investment and maintenance efforts. This approach has proven successful when implemented over larger areas within IDL farms (Indian Dairy Development Ltd.). For those considering starting a similar venture, it's suggested that they begin modestly with 10-20 trees rather than taking on too much at once. Over time, if maintained properly without neglecting security measures or seeking advice from local forest departments for sapling procurement tips, profits can be realized within 10 years through sales of products like Srikandha seeds which fetch approximately INR 100-INR 150 per kilogram post maturation period lasting upwards of ten years since initial plantation efforts began decades ago in some cases. Additionally, engaging in annual replantings ensures continuous growth cycles leading towards sustainable practices beneficial both economically and ecologically speaking across generations according to personal experiences shared herein over nearly eight decades spent working closely alongside nature itself."
