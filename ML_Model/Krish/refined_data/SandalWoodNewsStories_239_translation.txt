20 crores worth of Srikandha trees, native to Karnataka, offer significant economic value over a period of 14-15 years due to their high demand and medicinal properties. Each tree can potentially generate upwards of INR 7500 annually when fully matured (approximately 8-9 meters tall), with the potential for higher yields if cultivated effectively in suitable climates. The leaves and bark have various uses, including power generation from bioenergy plants that utilize them as fuel sources (producing approximately 800 kW of energy). For optimal growth, Srikandha trees require minimal watering initiallyâ€”only once every eight days for the first four months after planting. However, once established, they are drought resistant and can thrive even with limited irrigation. After ten years of care, these trees become self-sufficient in terms of moisture requirements; however, careful monitoring is necessary during this transition period to prevent mortality due to dehydration or environmental factors like heavy rainfall which could cause erosion around dam sites where these trees might be planted. If you're considering purchasing land with Srikandha trees or investing in this species for agricultural purposes, it's important to obtain governmental permissions before planting or cultivating them further post-monsoon seasons after an initial establishment phase. Proper maintenance and understanding the lifecycle stages will ensure long-term success and profitability from your investment in these valuable tropical hardwoods.
