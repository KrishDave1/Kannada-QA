The Raita Mahitya channel presents a detailed exploration of an investment opportunity involving the Srikandha tree, native to Karnataka. Thetree is highly valuable, estimated to be worth approximately 20 crores for a single stone. For those unable to afford such a price upfront, the video guides viewers through purchasing the tree at a more reasonable cost—around 5 to 10 rupees for small sizes and upwards of 20-40 rupees for larger ones. Over time, owning and nurturing this tree can provide substantial financial returns; individuals may earn around 15,000 rupees annually after fifteen years if they perform Maratha rituals following certain agricultural cycles—this earned income could increase significantly with proper care and maintenance due to its potential high yield in terms of gold production (up to several percent). Additionally, there are alternative methods using natural irrigation from rivers like Ganga or Yamuna which can enhance growth without additional costs. The video also emphasizes adherence to local regulations during cultivation and offers advice on obtaining necessary permissions within fourteen months prior to harvesting after fifteen years when the tree reaches maturity. The benefits don't just include financial gains but also promise better health outcomes post ten years of planting due to increased immunity provided by nature via these trees' properties.
