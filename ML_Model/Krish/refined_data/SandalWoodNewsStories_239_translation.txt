On the Raita Mahitya channel, a rare opportunity has been presented to viewers in Karnataka or those willing to invest in a valuable asset. A Srikandha tree, which is considered the most important in Karnataka and can potentially yield significant returns over 14 years, is up for grabs at an affordable price of approximately 20 crores (200 million INR). This tree promises power gains ranging from 5,000 to 15,000 units daily when harvested every fifteen years. Notably, each stone of gold equivalent can fetch about one-fourth of its weight in gold annually. The video emphasizes that subscribers should press the bell icon for updates and answers questions on this remarkable investment opportunity. Additionally, potential buyers are advised to consider water levels and soil conditions before purchasing since these factors influence the growth and survival of the tree; it requires careful irrigation especially during its first five years after planting or transplantationâ€”afterwhich it becomes more resilient under various conditions until reaching maturity around ten years later. After two decades from initial cultivation or replanting post-maturation era (year 15), extensive care must be taken as falling due to neglect could cause substantial harm leading possibly to loss by year 37+/-.
