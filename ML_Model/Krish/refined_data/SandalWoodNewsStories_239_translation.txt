In a detailed update from the Raita Mahitya channel, the host discusses an investment opportunity involving a specific tree, the Srikandha tree, native to Karnataka. This tree is highly valuable; its cost ranges roughly between 20 and 50 lakh rupees (2 to 5 crores), depending on size and location. The host emphasizes that those who plant this tree can reap financial benefits for up to 14 years, with potential returns of up to approximately 3-4% gold annually if one starts investing at age 15. For someone beginning at age 30 with no initial investment other than time and care for maintaining marathas (saplings), which grow from the fallen leaves of Srikandha trees planted previously, one could potentially earn around Rs. 15,000 per month by their mid-forties without any significant outlay beyond purchasing land or space for cultivation initially priced between Rs. 5 to Rs. 10 per unit when small but potentially more expensive once matured enough for such investments directly onto existing structures like walls or ground surfaces using techniques like hydroponics in places like Goodbye River where soil quality may not be optimal for traditional farming methods but still supports aquatic life forms well due perhaps unusual properties found within its watersï¿½all while encouraging environmental sustainability through natural growth cycles rather than artificial interventions post traumatic issues are also addressed by adhering strictly after a span of five years since starting marathas cultivation ensuring continuous health improvements over ten years until reaching full physical fitness again thanks largelyto careful consideration given towards step placement during early stages as well as later ones following proper authorization processes required by local authorities allowing changes/adjustments along with financial aid options available after fifteen additional years into maturity bringing about substantial weight gains further enhancing overall wellbeing!
