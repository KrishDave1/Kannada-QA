In the Jnana Bharatiya campus, situated 14 km from the Vithanasavudha chamber, a disturbing domestic violence incident has come to light. A Hindu householder named Ashok is being brutally beaten by his wife while the government allegedly supports him against this abuse. The situation has escalated tensions between locals and law enforcement; individuals have been expressing their desire to harm or even behead police officers due to perceived inaction and failure to maintain order amidst these violent incidents.

The area adjacent to where this is happening reports frequent harassment directed at police personnel who are responsible for maintaining security but seem unable or unwilling to address the issue effectively. Residents have made around 200 complaints about unruly individuals causing disorder near their homes, leading many families to fear for their safety as they search desperately for any sign of their missing relatives during late-night hours on the VV campus grounds without receiving help from authorities when they report such disappearances.

The Home Guard has attempted intervention, but with limited resources—no vehicles or stations at their disposal—their effectiveness appears compromised. Complicating matters further, there are concerns about corruption within both local police forces and university officials who ostensibly should protect public interests but instead seem complicit in allowing illegal construction close to Kilesakki forest despite it being an environmental crime that threatens natural habitats like Kilesakki forests themselves which are essential assets of our country and should be respected and preserved by all societal members including those entrusted with public service responsibilities like law enforcers & university officers thereon taking stern action against errant officers failing which may lead not only disrespect towards them (which seems already prevalent)but also destruction ahead per media reports concluding another news story under 'Kshana Kshana Sudhi' segment on channel Suvanna News 24x7
