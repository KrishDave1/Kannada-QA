The passage discusses the complexities and economic aspects of cultivating Srikand (Saussurea lappa), a crop essential for producing the fixative 'ambra' used in agriculture to enhance crop growth. Despite its high demand and cost, Srikand requires careful management due to its specific growing conditions and challenges such as requiring an alternate host for germination across various stages and trees. The economics of Srikand are intricate, influenced by factors like seedling quality, soil pH levels, organic carbon content, and optimal land preparation. Proper site selection is crucial; it involves assessing soil health through pH testing to ensure nutrient absorption efficiency. Land clearing must be done meticulously with consideration for pollution and soil structure before planting can commence around June.

Preparation includes creating pits at regular intervals along slopes—typically 11 meters for this context—after which permissions may need to be obtained from local forest departments if there is any subsidy involved in the project. Pitting must be timed appropriately; usually not during winter when temperatures drop as this could damage the newly planted saplings or seeds once they emerge after being sown ahead of time between January to March when warmer weather starts facilitating base development in the soil leading up to planting season. Once pits are made, topsoil should be added followed by shaping small hills where each sapling will be placed within a prepared farmyard area that accommodates 2-3 kg boxes containing precious seedlings whose roots must intermingle with surrounding earth rather than remaining encased in plastic covers used initially for transport or nursery care post-sowing but pre-transplantation into fields). Irrigation via flood methods is recommended following transplantation to support healthy growth until rainfall becomes reliable later in the season after initial plantings have been established without excessive moisture loss from evaporation or runoff difficulties often encountered with younger plants still adapting their root systems fully towards new environments/
