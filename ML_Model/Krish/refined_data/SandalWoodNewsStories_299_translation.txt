In a heart-wrenching dialogue, a son grapples with the harsh realities of poverty and his family's struggles as beggars. He questions his father about their plight and laments their lack of wealth, contrasting it with the affluence of his friends. The son feels profound disappointment in their circumstances and expresses a desire for financial stability to achieve happiness.

His conversation with Muthu revolves around the pursuit of money as the key to peace and prosperity, emphasizing that without means, there cannot be wealth or contentment.

The son is conflicted between staying for personal happiness versus leaving for lucrative business opportunities that promise better lives for him, his wife, and children. Amidst this emotional turmoil, he receives advice about detonating bombs metaphorically used to cleanse the air filled with false claims regarding an enchanting tree named Ratnaâ€”a remedy suggested by Kesava and Sanjiva against life-threatening poison affecting his sick child. In desperationaved belief in this miraculous cure over conventional medicine at the doctor's recommendation who seeks an actual Ratna tree sapling instead of traditional medication.

As tensions escalate over whether or not to cut down trees considered sacred out of necessity versus utility amidst adversity striking hard at both nature (trees) themselves along with mankind (the boy's mother crying out when her son falls ill), reconciliation seems distant until tragic turns lead back towards compassion: acknowledging debts owed by repaying lost gold which could save lives rather than succumbing to despair driven by monetary issues; accepting culpability for exploiting natural resources leading ultimately burning sacrificially chosen trees echoing a pattern tragically set forth generations ago but promising forgiveness if followed differently henceforth
