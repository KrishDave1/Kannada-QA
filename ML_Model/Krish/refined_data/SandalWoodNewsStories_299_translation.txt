In the narrative, a son laments his family’s low birth and lack of wealth, contrasting their poverty with the happiness he believes wealth would bring. His younger brother, Muthu, counters that contentment can be found in appreciating what one has rather than constantly yearning for more. The son, however, expresses frustration over his inability to earn money while his friends are financially successful, and he worries about providing for his family. Determined to alleviate their struggle, he plans a business trip. Tensions rise as the son confronts Kesava and Sanjiva over the cutting down of precious trees without consent, arguing that immediate financial concerns should take precedence over the potential long-term benefits of the trees. Amid this turmoil, tragedy strikes when the son accidentally poisons himself after returning home from receiving royal gifts during an anniversary celebration. Desperate and confused, and fearing further conflict or even violence due to environmental issues surrounding these sacred trees—which may hold medicinal properties—he seeks help from doctors. They advise using leaves from a rare tree called Ratna as a cure, a solution believed to be provided through divine intervention. In this moment of urgency and crisis management, reconciliation seems possible as debts are settled with gold, lost assets are restored, and lives are spared after drinking blessed water for healing and forgiveness. However, lingering resentments remain as old grievances resurface, following a series of missteps leading up to these events. Ultimately, these experiences prompt new resolutions toward respectful coexistence, balancing economic aspirations with a commitment to preserving ecological integrity.
