In the narrative, a son laments his family's low birth and lack of wealth, contrasting their poverty with the happiness he believes wealth would bring. His younger brother, Muthu, counters that contentment can be found in what one has rather than yearning for more. The son expresses frustration over being unable to earn money while his friends are financially successful. He worries about providing for his family but is determined to go on a business trip to alleviate their struggle. Tensions rise as the son confronts Kesava and Sanjiva regarding cutting down precious trees without consent, arguing that immediate financial concerns take precedence over long-term benefits. Amidst this turmoil, tragedy strikes when the son accidentally poisons himself upon returning home after receiving royal gifts for an anniversary celebration. Desperate and confused amidst fears of further conflict or even violence due to environmental issues involving these sacred trees (which may hold medicinal properties), he seeks help from doctors who advise using leaves from a rare tree called Ratna—a solution provided by divine intervention—to cure him before it's too late. In moments of urgency and crisis management, reconciliation seems possible as debt settled with gold restored lost assets and lives were spared after drinking water blessed under guidance toward healing and forgiveness; however lingering resentments remain as old grievances resurface following missteps leading up to these events; ultimately prompting new resolutions towards respectful coexistence between economic aspirations & ecological integrity
