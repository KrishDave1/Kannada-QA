The farm is located 68 km from Bangalore and offers live video tours via YouTube and Google platforms. Notably, Greenwood Farm does not practice traditional agriculture; instead, it utilizes high-tech methods with weekly training sessions conducted by experts from various regions across Karnataka. These training sessions aim to educate participants on both theoretical concepts and practical farming skills through hands-on experience at the farm. Suresh emphasizes that young individuals should consider careers in agriculture as an alternative to seeking employment elsewhere or inheriting family property. He encourages them to earn income through innovative farming techniques rather than relying solely on one crop or traditional methods. **Economic Potential of Agriculture:** Suresh highlights several profitable crops grown at Greenwood Farm without reliance on borewells during rainy seasons—earning approximately 10-12 lakhs annually while sustaining ecological balance using natural resources like forests and water bodies responsibly. He criticizes the common practice of buying expensive vegetables due to poor marketing strategies within India's agricultural sector and suggests that proper marketing can significantly improve profitability for farmers.
