The narrative begins with an introduction to Atmeyar Raitar's L.D. area in Belagavanjala, where farmer Sidra Irapa, who initially engaged in traditional farming following his ancestors, diversified into cultivating Srikandada Gidakala trees on a 10-acre plot in Hattuekara within Kottalagi village. Sidra initiated this venture, motivated by the increasing costs of labor (INR 65 per day), cow dung (INR 340 per quintal), and medicine (INR 825 for treatment), which made conventional farming economically unfeasible given the lack of guaranteed work or water supply. Over three years, Sidra planted more than 80,000 Srikandada Gidakala trees across his farmland, adopting various species to ensure biodiversity and sustainability of the forest land he has strived to protect. His goal is to achieve a future income from tree sales potentially exceeding INR 1 crore annually after fifteen years of investment, without relying on private entities like educational institutions that may provide scholarships or other financial support. Farmers like Sidra directly benefit from these investments, receiving as much as INR 4 lakh annually, a practice established approximately thirty years ago, contrasted with other regions abroad where caste diversity exists—a consideration currently under review, especially in cases involving house construction within the forest upon acquiring permission, expected to persist for at least seven decades. This situation introduces potential issues that could hinder progress, though prohibited measures have prevented further concerns. Additionally, Sidra incurs expenses of approximately INR XXXX crores annually due to the limited irrigation requirements of the land, necessitating the installation of anti-theft devices costing INR 2-3 lakh yearly, along with an additional expenditure of INR XXX lakh for construction projects unified under a single management. Maintaining cleanliness and preservation efforts requires regular cleaning and maintenance, as recommended and suggested by received advice, all of which Sidra has accepted and acknowledged. Despite certain opposition or indifference toward the associated costs, the expense of maintaining a single Srikandada Gidakala tree alone could be considerable if not properly managed. The preservation, protection, and eventual production of this initiative are expected to yield prodigious profits and outcomes, with the results anticipated to fulfill Sidra’s goals, achieving accomplishments and successes that fully realize his vision and purpose through assured service and delivered assistance, while enthusiasm for this venture continues to grow.
