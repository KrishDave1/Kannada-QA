The Onion Chopra district's farmers are actively engaged in collecting sandalwood (Srikanda) from approximately 100 acres of land. They have been gathering at the location since noon and have processed around 600 kg of sandalwood. These individuals hail from various parts of India and Karnataka, seeking information on land conservation, disease prevention, and government facilities related to Srikanda cultivation. Sandalwood is a commercially significant tree known as "Chandana" in Hindi or "Santalum album" scientifically. It grows across different regions globally, including India, Australia, Indonesia, and Thailand. In India specifically, there are 16 distinct varieties of sandalwood with "Santalum scelerocarpum," commonly referred to as Srikanda SC or Chandanavruksha being particularly valued for its medicinal and aromatic qualities. Historically regulated by laws dating back to Tipu Sultan's era in 1782 and continued under the Shatamanas until recent amendments in 2020/2100 CE allowing private individuals to grow sandalwood without special permissions. Sandalwood is now considered a royal tree due to its historical significance as a property exclusively owned by kings during Tipu Sultan's reign. The trees can be propagated by attaching stem cuttings to existing bodies of water on farms where other crops like rice or coconuts may also be grown concurrently. The forest department plays a crucial role in monitoring the growth cycle; once matured (approximately 16-17 years), these trees become economically viable for harvesting based on their weight measured in quintalsâ€”with each ton fetching upwards of INR 2 crores through state-run outlets like KSDL (Karnataka Sandal Detergents Limited). Retail sales include pure sandalwood oil packaged in small quantities suitable for personal use or larger quantities intended for industrial purposes such as textile processing with prices ranging from INR 5 lakhs per kilogram wholesale upwards depending on quality grades A & B identified by experts at IISc Bangalore using NIR spectroscopy techniques before being sold domestically within Karnataka markets like Iswantpur near Bangalore retailing products ranging from sachets priced
