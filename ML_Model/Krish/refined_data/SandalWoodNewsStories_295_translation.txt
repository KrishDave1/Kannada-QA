The video delves into India's rich history, highlighting a lesser-known aspect of its ancient heritage tied to a phenomenon called the "blood moon." This non-formal tree, Terra corpus centillus, is native to South India, particularly the end of Andhra Pradesh, where it bears high-quality blood moon trees. These trees are unique in that they house stone-like moons weighing between 20 to 30 kilograms each; an entire tree can support upwards of 20 to 30 kg of these stones. A single stone from such a tree can be valued at INR 20k to INR 30k (approximately), while a full bloom blood moon tree weighing around tonnage could fetch upwards of INR 2 crores due to their rarity and medicinal properties.

Historically, these blood moon flowers were used in Ayurvedic medicine for curing skin conditions but have since gained global recognition as valuable components in traditional remedies and luxurious items due to their efficacy and expense—comparable even with petrol prices in India despite being exceedingly rare within the country itself. In China, which imports large quantities for medicinal uses across illnesses including Japan and Mongolia, the value increases significantly because of their healing capabilities over thousands of diseases. Consequently, there's considerable Chinese interest in preserving these precious trees against overseas exploitation or illegal extraction that threatens their existence despite historical records indicating usage during China’s Ming dynasty (14th century).

To protect this national treasure amidst international demand driven by both medical applications and illicit activities like smuggling across borders where they command astronomical figures comparable only to African Blackwood priced at approximately £8 per kg internationally yet more abundant found within regions like Kenya and Tanzania after harvest cycles lasting up to five decades longer than those required locally thanks partly owing protection policies aimed at safeguarding them from poaching thus maintaining cultural continuity through careful stewardship passed down generation upon generation affecting various facets pertaining agriculture livelihood economies worldwide especially when considering alternative crop options available today providing similar commercially viable outcomes minus environmental degradation issues inherent with unchecked deforestation practices seen histor
