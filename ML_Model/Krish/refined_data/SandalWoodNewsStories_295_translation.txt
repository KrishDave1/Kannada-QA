The content of the video delves into the rich history of India, emphasizing its ancient structures and significant historical events, including the presence of a rare lunar phenomenon known as the "blood moon." This particular blood moon is associated with a tree called Terra corpus centillus, native to South India and particularly abundant in the Andhra Pradesh region. Dubbed as 'Srinavami Akkam,' this species is highly valued both for its medicinal properties and its role in traditional medicine across Asia. With stones embedded within it, these trees can hold up to 20-30 kg of precious stone blocks; if illegally smuggled and processed, they could be worth upwards of INR 6 lakhs each. A single meter cube (approximately 1 kg) of blood moon stone fetches between INR 20-30 thousand. Consequently, an entire tree weighing about 10 tons could potentially assure wealth amounting to approximately INR 2 crores due to its valuable components used internationally by China for treating thousands of diseases. Historically linked to China's Ming dynasty that used these treasures extensively in their palaces around the 14th century AD., reports suggest that over exploitation has led hundreds of years later to illegal logging efforts despite strict regulations aimed at preservation due to their immense value both economically and culturally—with an estimated yearly black market trade volume exceeding INR 20 trillion Rupees annually—and legal possession carrying penalties upwards between seven years imprisonment based on severity claims that there exists no direct substitute or equivalent resource globally given its unique attributes which make it one among many wonders found only in specific regions within our planet Earth today!
