In Kavishti, Vijayalakshmi Shibhar recounts a tale that underscores the stark contrast between India's aspirations and reality. The narrative begins with the assumption that post-pandemic life would rid India of its unpleasant odors, only to introduce an allegory where wildlife deaths led to improved air quality. She then delves into the enigmatic story of a forest in Bangalore where efforts to steal 'crores of rupees worth' fragrance from sacred trees have uncovered a larger environmental issue—the gross negligence towards preserving nature amidst urban development. Despite this discovery, during a visit to Jnanabharati University campus by those passionate about conservation, they encountered shocking conditions: extensive plastic waste pollution had destroyed many trees once thriving in what should have been lush green spaces.

The activists were initially disheartened but their spirits lifted upon entering the temple grounds within Jnanabharati where they witnessed surviving sacred trees valued upwards of 20-25 thousand rupees per piece due to their rare fragrances associated with Sri Gandha or Karunada Kirti fame. These iconic trees are under threat as invaders plant new ones overnight but these saplings disappear after just one or two days, leading many to observe eerie deforestation at work right before their eyes despite evident greenery around. The narrator reminisces about how these forests used to teem with holy and aromatic flora back in the 1980s when Sri Gandha was abundantly perfumed every day; however, since her arrival at Jnanabharati in 1983 until present times, she has not encountered any such tree on campus anymore—a testament to significant ecological loss over decades.

The situation is compounded by construction activities where statues require daily sacrifices of multiple trees which further contributes to air pollution near roadside areas plagued by poor sanitation practices including cutting down small wall-like structures housing vegetation and leaving them for weeks before chopping them up entirely for fuel or other purposes without proper oversight from environmental departments tasked with controlling odor issues emanating from such actions using advanced machinery capable of felling entire shrubberies within mere seconds sparking concerns among locals who fear involvement if caught using similar equipment themselves while urging for proactive measures instead reactively dealing with consequences later on
