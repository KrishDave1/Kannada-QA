Refined Text for QA Model: Welcome to Kavishti and introductions aside, the narrative focuses on environmental concerns in Bangalore. The story unfolds with a group led by Vijayalakshmi Shibhar observing the aftermath of wild animal deaths, which initially seemed to improve air quality conditions in India. However, they soon learn about an intriguing situation involving thefts amounting to crores (hundreds of millions) of rupees from a forested area within Bangalore. Upon investigation, it becomes apparent that these allegedly stolen funds are linked to illegal activities related to deforestation and waste disposal. The group encounters a severely polluted environment at Jnanabharati University's campus, where plastic waste has damaged trees and wildlife habitats. Despite this grim scenario, their spirits lift upon entering the nearby temple grounds, which contrast sharply with the surrounding pollution—a stark reminder of nature's value amidst human neglect. The temple grounds reveal that sacred trees are being illegally harvested; individual pieces fetch upwards of 20-25 thousand rupees each on the black market. The group discovers that security measures are inadequate against such exploitation. They express concern over Sri Gandha—a revered tree known as Karunada's glory—whose destruction symbolizes broader environmental degradation within the city's forests despite efforts like nighttime replanting initiatives aimed at regenerating greenery lost during daylight hours due to lack of surveillance or protection mechanisms in place by local authorities or bioparks tasked with controlling pollution levels without effective enforcement strategies or public cooperation towards conservation efforts .
