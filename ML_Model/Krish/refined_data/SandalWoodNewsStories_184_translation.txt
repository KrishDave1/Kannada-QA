In a detailed explanation addressed to friends, the importance of host and light for the growth of Srikant is demonstrated. The discussion revolves around Srikant's 7th year as they observe significant differences in plant growth between plants hosted in adequate conditions versus those growing naturally without human intervention. The primary focus is on how access to sunlight impacts plant development; specifically, it highlights that even when two houses (plants) are structurally similar but receive different amounts of light due to their surroundings, there can be substantial variances in growthâ€”often with one house surpassing heights of 10 feet within a year and reaching upwards of 20 feet. It emphasizes that it isn't merely the height that matters but rather how well the plants utilize light by circulating it across their structures, which affects heat distribution: ideally, about 30% atop and 70% below. Importantly, the speaker advocates for better-quality inputs for farmers through improved sashi variety selection and cautions against misinformation leading to farmer losses and financial setbacks. They express a desire to assist farmers by providing quality support while urging them not to make unnecessary changes detrimental to themselves or others based on faulty advice. The message concludes with an appeal for constructive feedback from peers who may have concerns or questions about this approach
