It appears you've repeated the greeting "Welcome to the group" multiple times. To provide a meaningful summary, I would need additional content beyond welcomes aloneâ€”details about what this group entails, its purpose, or any key information that new members should know. If each repetition includes unique information specific to different aspects of joining or participating in the group, please ensure to include those points for an accurate summarization. If you're looking for a concise way to acknowledge someone who has joined your group with enthusiasm and emphasis on their inclusion, then simply stating "You are now part of our community; we welcome you!" could suffice as a collective welcome message without replication.
