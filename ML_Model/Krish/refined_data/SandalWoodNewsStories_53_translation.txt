 Vinay is conducting an experiment to test the formation of hot wood (a type of wood with antimicrobial properties) in a sun root tree that is approximately 4.5 years old and has a girth of about 40 cm. Using an increment borer, he carefully extracted a core sample from the tree to examine the presence of hot wood. The process involved inserting the instrument into the tree, retrieving the core sample once it was inside, and then using a spoon-like tool to remove the sampled wood without damaging any surrounding tissue. During this procedure, they observed that there was no strong odor indicative of mature hot wood but detected signs suggesting that its formation had begun in response to bacterial infection within young sapwoodâ€”an early stage known as initiation or "hot start." Although not fully formed yet, these initial stages are significant markers for studying trees' natural defense mechanisms against decay post mortem or pathogen attacks while alive. To prevent any rainwater entering through the newly created hole left by extracting coresamples vinay plans to seal it with a stick; he anticipates that new hot wood will form at this site within three months following sealing., Congratulations were due even before full maturation because detecting such early changes indicates progress in understanding how these unique defensive tissues develop and function within living trees.
