 Vinay is conducting a test on a 4.5-year-old sunroot tree that has a girth of approximately 40 cm to evaluate the presence and extent of 'hot wood,' which is part of the natural process where sapwood converts into heartwood. To accomplish this, Vinay is using an increment borer to extract a core sample from the tree. The procedure involves inserting the borer, retrieving the core sample once it's securely in place, and then carefully removing it with assistance from a tool referred to as a spoon. During the removal process, he notes a faint smell indicative of lignificationâ€”a sign that hot wood formation has initiated in the young tree. Although complete conversion hasn't begun yet, this preliminary indication is promising news for foresters monitoring heartwood development. After completing the extraction, Vinay plans to fill any resulting hole left by closing it with one stick; such interventions do not significantly impact subsequent fire retardancy properties within three months after plantation due to continuous conversion processes within trees destined to form heatwood naturally over time.
