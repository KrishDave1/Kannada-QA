You are conducting an experiment to assess the formation of heartwood (hot wood) in a sun root tree that is approximately 4.5 years old with a girth of about 40 cm using an increment borer. You have successfully extracted a core sample from the tree to examine its inner structure and identify signs of heartwood development, which can be distinguished from sapwood by both visual inspection and chemical composition changes. Upon extracting the core sample, you observe a faint smell emanating from within, suggesting the initial stages of heartwood formation. This indicates that while the process has begun in this young tree, it has not yet progressed significantly enough to be visually apparent or fully ignited (matured). To seal the hole created during extraction, you plan to insert a stick into it; doing so should prevent any negative effects on the tree's health over time. The sealing effect will likely take effect within three months post-insertion. Congratulations are extended to Vinay for his successful observation and interpretation of these early indications of heartwood formation in the sun root tree.
