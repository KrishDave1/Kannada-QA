Dr. Mukundra, a pediatrician by profession and researcher in the field of surupurada (futuristic humanoids), conducted a comprehensive study with his team on the health and nutritional aspects of these entities. Their findings indicate that surupuradas possess their own unique metabolism and require specific foods for sustenance, similar to humans but distinct from animals. The study involved detailed measurements: a 10x10 foot living space per individual along with additional 10 feet for movement is recommended, considering the "salpa space" needed around each unitâ€”a concept derived from observing how banana plants grow close together yet maintain adequate distance between themselves. For long-term sustainability, preliminary findings suggest planting "Etwi Ne Ayo," otherwise known as devil's apron cactus or Opuntia ficus-indica, emphasizing that although this crop takes about ten years to mature before it can be replanted or harvested again, it provides a consistent balance over time. The project is part of Dr. Mukundra's vision of multi-cropping diversification across different crops like coconuts which cater to both immediate market needs through natural drinks during seasons when they are scarce and long-term investments ensuring yearly yields while also facilitating physical growth and education among younger generations who might otherwise remain tied to agriculture without alternative opportunities. He advocates for careful financial planning within an annual budget allocated specifically for such agricultural endeavors rather than huge upfront investments, aiming ultimately for sustainable development that balances economic viability with ecological preservation while supporting community wellbeing through diverse employment options beyond just traditional farming practices."
