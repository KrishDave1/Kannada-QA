The text appears to be discussing two types of corn: chemical corn and scuba soil (presumably a type of compost or enriched soil). For clarity, let's refine the information into a concise summary for a BERT-based QA model: "There are two distinct types of agricultural products being considered here. One is 'chemical corn,' which refers to conventional maize possibly treated with chemicals during its growth cycle. The other is referred to as 'scuba soil,' likely indicating nutrient-rich or composted soil suitable for planting. Both have different applications; while chemical corn can be stored in packages without sticks and spread broadly as fertilizer, scuba soil condition should involve incorporating it directly into the ground as an amendment for better crop yields. A key point mentioned is that oxygen has been added to improve the quality of the chemical corn before distribution."
