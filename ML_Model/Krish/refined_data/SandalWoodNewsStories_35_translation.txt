The narrative introduces Tanda, a character who inadvertently becomes part of an intricate tale involving blood moon smugglers in the last village of Andhra, Aranya. The Andhra government has established a Special Task Force (STF) to combat these smugglers following a deadly shootout that claimed 20 lives two years prior. Despite this, the illicit activities surrounding the 'blood moon' property continue, with plans underway to expand operations into other states. Tanda and his companions suspect Kattigana-Halli-Shekada-Tombattarashtra as the center of these illegal dealings but notice unusual behavior among its residents upon investigation, leading them to distrust their own findings. Their pursuit leads them through various encounters and close calls; at one point, they are surrounded by police or vigilantes numbering around 20 while armed with just three men against overwhelming odds. In their attempt to escape from being identified near a water pool after dark—and possibly targeted for assassination—they dive into the water and manage to reach safety on the main road where they abandoned their car before making their way back cautiously without drawing attention or becoming further entangled in this dangerous saga which continues beyond this account with more unforeseen events waiting ahead.
