The narrative begins with the introduction of Tanda, a character who unwittingly becomes part of an intricate tale involving smugglers and law enforcement in Andhra's last village, Aranya. After his death, it is revealed that brave soldiers are on a mission to confront these criminals linked to the 'blood moon,' who have been responsible for illicit activities across several states including Andhra and Tamilnadu. The Andhra government has established a special security force, STF, which two years earlier engaged in a shootout against 20 blood moon thieves resulting in their deaths. Despite this setback, the smuggling operations continue as they plan to invest their earnings from properties in Aranya into other regions.

The story delves into the dynamics between the villagers of Kattigana-Halli-Shekada-Tombattarashtra and suspected shadowy figures connected to the blood moon trade. Investigators pose as buyers but discover that some locals suspect these individuals instead. During their investigation overnight, they encounter various challenges where identities remain obscured amidst suspicion and deception; eventually realizing key players like Somwara Siguna hold vital information about transactions leading to Lord Shiva's Archâ€”the final destination for smuggled goods (a metaphorical term).

A young man named Baba takes center stage when he receives instructions from Somwara Siguna via phone call after visiting Kattigana-Halli under false pretenses due to fear induced by local dealer Cost McCoy during handover discussions before sunrise at Sirawada near water bodies now turned crime scenes marked by burial sites rather than religious nuns (a possible miscommunication or euphemism used). A high-speed chase ensues when Baba along with his companions narrowly escapes an ambush set up by police officers identified either as Mahitya Dharma or members of another group intercepted during pursuit through Bangalore streets where hired bikers attempted multiple assassination attempts over a stretch lasting roughly 12 kilometers before finally arriving safe back home while reflecting on how deeply entangled this web extends even beyond state boundaries posing significant legal investigative hurdles despite best efforts put forth by sympathetic authorities involved in combating such cross border crimes related to black market trafficking referred colloquially within context as "blood moons."
