The narrative begins with a reference to a character named Tanda, who encounters an individual identified as "P" discussing security measures regarding smugglers known as "blood moon thieves." These criminals have been engaged in illicit activities in Andhra's last village, Aranya, and are planning to expand their operations into neighboring states. The Andhra government has established a Special Task Force (STF) to combat this threat; two years prior, a shootout involving blood moon thieves resulted in the deaths of 20 of them. Despite these efforts, the blood moon thieves continue their operations from their stronghold in Kattigana-Halli-Shekada-Tombattarashtra. The narrative suggests that local villagers may be complicit or at least aware of the smugglers' activities. A character named Baba attempts to gather information about the blood moon by posing as someone interested in acquiring it but discovers that those involved are keeping secrets about its location and distribution. Baba eventually obtains contact information for Somwara Siguna but finds that when he tries to meet him at Kattigana-Halli after being given misleading directions, he is met with suspicion and fear among locals who speak in code and call for reinforcements upon recognizing outsiders. After narrowly escaping confrontation by fleeing into a water pool near Sirawada where they were following another suspect linked to the blood moon operation, Baba and his companions manage to evade capture long enough to return home safely despite being pursued by assailants on motorcycles intending harm along their route back Bangalore.
