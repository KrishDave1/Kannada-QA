Om Namaste, You are addressing a special guest, Pawan Kumar, known as the Karnataka Sandalwood lady and a mentor in financial freedom apps. She has inspired many with her expertise in agriculture and personal development. You recount discovering her through a viral video where she shared insights on sugarcane cultivation.

Her pricing strategy is designed around fair compensation reflecting each type of produce's unique value proposition amidst changing consumer preferences over time spanning nearly five decades since she started farming at age 20-25 years old until present times when advocating for wealth creation among rural populations through sustainable agri
