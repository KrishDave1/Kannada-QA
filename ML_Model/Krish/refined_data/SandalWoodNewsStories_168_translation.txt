Shrikanda farming presents a lucrative opportunity for Indian and Australian farmers, particularly in regions like Kandada. The potential for high earnings is evident as one Shrikanda Gita can yield at least 1 lakh rupees, with the possibility of earning up to 1 crore from 100 Shrikandas. Historically, India's agricultural landscape underwent significant transformation post-1960 when the country faced widespread poverty. By 2026, Shrikanda cultivation had expanded to cover an area of approximately 2.9 million hectares (equivalent to about 29 million acres), reflecting its economic importance and growth potential. Currently, there is a steady demand for around 6,000 to 7,000 tons of Shrikanda annually. This has led cosmetic and perfume industries to take notice due to the valuable essential oils produced by the plant. With increasing global interest in natural products and sustainable agriculture practices, Shirkanda farming stands out as an attractive venture offering substantial returns on investment if managed effectively over large tracts such as thousands of acres rather than just hundreds or tens of acres—a concept demonstrated successfully by Sadhaka Ramesh Valluutagi who farms on both small (1/4th acre) and larger scales (5/8ths an acre). The Freedom App Research Team has developed a comprehensive online course dedicated to Shririkhanda agriculture that covers all aspects from land requirements and government incentives down to soil preparation techniques; water needs; crop management strategies including pest control measures; legal permissions required; environmental protection methods; maintenance protocols; success factors for profitable cultivation; export procedures; cost analysis against profits generated through this enterprise—all culminating in practical knowledge necessary for successful implementation of this agro business initiative across various terrains using different modules within the course structure leading towards certification upon completion which also provides accessibility options via their marketplace platform where users can purchase numerous 'Freedom Apps'. The course emphasizes turning expertise into income opportunities without restrictions on product changes once acquired through downloadable resources available now."
