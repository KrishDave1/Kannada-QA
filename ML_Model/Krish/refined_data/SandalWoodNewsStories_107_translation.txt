This thorny shrub serves as a natural fence due to its sharp spines, which deter intruders effectively. It is not only functional but also visually appealing when integrated into landscaping. The fruits of the Kavle Gada are an additional benefit; they are profitable and can be sold at approximately 70 rupees per kilogram. Moreover, these plants have practical uses beyond their beauty â€“ they can act as fencing for protecting bird nests or other areas that require securing without artificial barriers.
