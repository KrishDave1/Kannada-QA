 The government is giving us a lot of schemes. The government schemes are being given by the farmers. The world's most costly wood is agarwood. It is very expensive. 1 kg of agarwood costs 16 lakhs. If it is used for oil, it is even more costly. We estimate approximately 2-3 crores. The youth is being used as a scavenger every night. We have to have two cars in front of our house, gold in our hands and gold in our hands. We have to change our style. If the youth wants, they can do anything. They can drink the right kind of liquor and meat. I would like to visit my farm once. I want to see how a youth can earn a living. Hello to all viewers. My name is Suresh Babantha. I am from Greenwood Farm, Kolaru. This farm is located near KMF Dairy. It is a greenwood farm in Karnataka. This farm is 68 km from Bangalore. You can get a live video of the farm on YouTube, Google and Greenwood Farm. You can also get a live video of Satya Sahir Uddhashnambandhu. It is 1 km from KMF Dairy. The farmers are losing their jobs by relying on one single crop. So, we have decided to do a whole crop without any borewell. The speciality of Greenwood Farm is that there is no agriculture in our farm. We have installed it as a very high-c Tech Every week we get training from Karnataka, Gulbarga, Haveri, Koppala, Bidar The special thing about our training is that at least when we see the farm we have to learn 50% What is there in our farm? We have to learn the method to build the farm and then another 50% They learn from the theoretical concept we give them The theoretical concept is that we don't show any projectors or TVs What profit I am making What profit I am getting from the chicken What profit I am getting from the chicken We give them an explanation live This is our main job How many youths I am asking this to Karnataka Jamunthi Youths, leaving their parents' property They have to study SLC or PUC degree and go to Bangalore and earn 10,000 rupees and earn 10 years and then they can earn some money and then they can leave their land and their parents and then they can live and then they can do whatever they want Please visit my farm and see if there is a youth who is not a zero who is not a zero who is not a zero They can earn at least 10,000 rupees per month They can live peacefully Today, if you invest 50,000 rupees you can earn at least 10,000 rupees per month What you have to do for this is you have to use the scientific method What should be the scientific method If you watch it on YouTube or if you watch any video you won't learn But the meaning of the meaning of the meaning should be understood by every youth The main thing is for youth What is happening to youth today is that we have to be active every night At night, when it is morning we should have two cars in front of our house and gold in our hands and gold in our hands This is what the youth think This is what the youth think What I am saying to the youth is that please go there and become an office boy become a delivery boy become security Instead of spending 10,000 rupees or 20,000 rupees you should be a wonderful person We don't have any borewells in our land We are doing this in the rain We are earning at least 10 to 12 lakhs a year But I am telling the youth instead of spending money they should be a part of it My main profession is I am a teacher I am doing this as a part of it I am giving this as a gift This concept is for youth Our expert says If youth changes the country will change If youth doesn't change the country will not change If youth wants, it can do anything That's why I am saying drink the best of the best drink the best of the best If youth is there the country will change What is the concept of this concept All types of pet animals are there We are raising the cougar as a commercial We have chickens We have the hound We have the swan We have 700 bloods 600 bloods We have 35 hunting traps We have lich, dragon fruit moose, cow, coconut jackfruit, palm tree, palm tree We have all these concepts These are all hunting traps We have built a farm in the middle of the country We have the food we need in the farm We have the food We have the wood We have peace We have peace We have happiness We have the right to do all these things Youth will use our training and our farm This is the speciality What is the speciality of the farm The farm is a long-term crop The farm has the rice fields We have to harvest the rice If we harvest the rice we need to have the energy to grow the crop The farmers say we need to grow the crop and keep investing They get the motivation What do you say about this This is a very simple question The R&D method needs to be implemented for 12 years I am saying that the government will pay you 5% for the farm and the maintenance will be done with the help of the forest and the water The way I see it is that if you go to the market and buy a tomato for 20 rupees you will get it for 2 rupees If you buy it for 2 rupees you will get 1 lakh rupees I am saying that you should do the marketing and when you do the marketing you will see the speciality If you do the marketing you will see the failure of your farming Failure If the tomato we buy is 5 rupees the farmer will do it for 40 rupees What should we do to be successful We have to build a market for the farmers So the government should start the FBO and the farmers producing organization People are not aware Start the market and do the marketing The means are very good You can get the marketing with the help of the means That's why I am saying that if you do the marketing you will see the difference between the trees If you leave 4-5 trees like coconut, adike bluegill, silver, teak I know that There is no loss to the trees in the lower part Now there is the heavy If you burn all the trees there is no loss in the lower part What we can do is to do the marketing in the lower part I know that we can plant the trees in the lower part What we can do is to plant trees We have to plant trees We have to plant trees We have to plant trees We have to plant trees I have planted trees because I am dreaming for the second or third year I am dreaming that the trees will grow I have planted trees I have hosted Srikandha and made mulberry I have been thinking about Srikandha for the last 20 years I have 16 lakhs of Srikandha How many lakhs will we get if we sell 600? We should not do that I can do everything I have a stem I have a stem for wood or play wood I have five thousand for the blue tree I have four thousand for the minimum I have five thousand for the minimum I have five thousand for the minimum I have fifty lakhs It is a huge amount It is a huge amount I want our youth I want our youth to be ready at night I want my car to be ready at night If this is the concept in the whole of agriculture put everything do not put the whole tree if the tree is lost, the chicken is lost if the chicken is lost, the mutton is lost if the mutton is lost, the fish is lost if the fish is lost, the aranya is lost if the aranya is lost, make a small garden make a hand garden make a hand garden all these methods if you go to the market you have to sell then you will get profit in every one in agriculture if you do marketing in every one in agriculture you have to be very scientific now we are in dry land everything is dry land I have put only the trees for dry land I have not put trees that need water some people say to put agasai but I have not put agasai what is needed for dry land I will put a bale for rain and a bale for rain it will be flat in the base we will do silage in the base we will stock in silage in the rainy season we will put the logs in the base the logs will be dry we will see that there is a chicken going on that is why I say you have to see the value the scientific value in every one what profit we get think commercially people think that agriculture cannot be thought commercially think commercially you can at least get that benefit what the farmer is doing today I have asked we have a land it will be destroyed just put some wood how much effort is wasted if you put that effort in other places how big will you make it many people some people come and go they say that the land is not good if you come and go you put the land the oil fields some people take the land take the land and then do marketing and do it creatively all this is scientific if you are a farmer you can do marketing you need to have knowledge you need to have knowledge the central government is doing the farmer producing organization I am telling to a few farmers do marketing I have put more farmers more farmers should be put it is not happening because the farmer is not aware this is a concept what do you think from our marketing I have seen this I have not seen this is a concept I have not seen there are many fans many people call the people of Gulbarg call and ask for training as per me there are 150 people more than 150 because if you see south side you can see the farm if you see the farm you can see the harvest and then you can see the harvest next year from your channel I am ready to answer all the critical questions what else can you say some people don't know there is a difference between Raktachandana and Srikandha this is the main what is the difference between Raktachandana and Srikandha Paravalambi Gida there is no support for this people need hosting people come and ask for something what is the difference after Srikandha you put wood purpose Paravalambi and then other and then other some people put mulberry some people put Nugya some people put Haksa some people put Mahagani some people put Hebeva both wood purpose is weak Srikandha needs Paravalambi Raktachandana needs Paravalambi Raktachandana grows individually Srikandha goes to wood and to hayal this is the angle of Srikandha this is the angle of Srikandha Raktachandana as I know goes to wood Srikandha is very good today in the world the most costly wood is Agarwood the most costly wood Agarwood is expensive we have training we give information about where to get Agarwood Agarwood is expensive in Karnataka in Karnataka in a royal I have given 10 sashi of Agarwood now it is expensive we have to inject and do grafting if it is expensive what kind of weather is needed for that? not in normal weather after the hunting after the hunting we have to do some scientific methods we have to do all that and plan in a way that is easy to forget we have to use the information how long does Srikandha take to grow? if you want to grow try land minimum 20 years 20 years is needed if you have some natural resources it will take 15-16 years how much can you plant in one acre? one acre is enough for Srikandha depending on the main price or sub price depending on that minimum is 150 to 200 comfortable if it is too much it will not grow government gives many schemes government schemes are there all departments are there every training every week I tell all schemes IHR schemes all farmers should know after training we give an authorized certificate if you want to do something you can do it you will get a benefit for example if you plant Srikandha in one acre how much can you see after 20 years? I told you if one kg of Srikandha grows it will cost 16 lakhs if it goes to oil it will cost more approximately 2-3 crores from 2014-15 we have a lot government gave us everyone can plant in Kasgi land if you plant in 10 acres you will not get as per our numbers if you plant once or twice you will get profit if you plant in 10 acres it will take 6-7 years if you plant in 10 acres you will get the same clarity how much can you plant in one acre? same you can plant in 100 acres if you plant in 10 acres you can plant in 250 acres how much can you plant in one acre? same, 20 years how much can you see after 20 years? Srikandha is not that much 1 crore, 2 crores approximately that much today's number I don't know what will happen next what is the use of this plant? what can you see after 20 years? there is a science in this plant there is a concept that is called Hebev many people don't know about this the first hebev that hebev when you plant it the soup will be very tasty the stem of the tree will grow the tree will grow and the leaves will grow the hebev we plant the taste of soup is a little less than the native hebev but in future we can plant the stem and the mark that's why we plant hebev like this instead of the native hebev the seeds that have been crossed the hebev that the government gives we get in private nurseries because of this hebev when you plant it in future you can plant the stem and sell it for a good purpose the stem is not that much if you do any kind of brokerage it will go to the level of the plant if you do any kind of brokerage it will go to the level of the plant the profit is that you can sell it the needs of the farmers the importance of marketing that is the speciality of hebev finally about this crop farming and your training system what do you say to the farmers and the youth I always ask the youth to please don't leave the property of the country as a dry land India is a country of the fields a country that is the main agricultural every youth instead of going to the farm and growing the property of the country it's okay if there is no land plant the land in a good way plant the tree get good air and rain if we are clean the next generation will be good what is happening now everything is getting destroyed every person has a lot of money and they have done good work in this field my last conclusion finally your valuable time and information with us and to the people who have given it to us thank you very much thank you
