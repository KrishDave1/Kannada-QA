 Hi, welcome to Daru Group. Today we are in Sringada garden. This is a garden that we have developed a year ago. It is a little far from that, but I am telling you as a reference. Because we have made three videos about this same garden. In the same year, from the day of planting, after 6 months, what kind of results have been shown. Today it has been a year. Today we are doing is, I will tell you some details. In the previous video, our farmer will give his opinion. You can watch. If anyone is new to the channel, please subscribe to the channel. If you are watching the video, please subscribe. Subscription is free. Please do it. If you have not joined the channel yet, you can join the channel. There will be an exclusive video. If you are interested, there may be a complete detail. If you have a direct contact with the team, if you have a chance, through video calling, if you show your garden, we will give you a consultation. This is our plot. What we have done here is, we have alternated G Vilas and Srikandha. In this 3 acres area, we have G Vilas and Srikandha. This is the name. The reason for this plot is, in this area, when the crop is being cultivated, sugar cane cultivation was going on. We have selected that plot. We have selected it and we have recognized the lowest point and highest point. We know the height and the low point. We have identified the lowest point and the lowest point. Because the water from the next stream comes out of the water. The water from the stream comes out of the water. We have identified that first. We have taken the drip channels and the planting direction for the same line. Interproperly, from the last one year, coriander is being grown here. Coriander is being grown here. The opinion of Anish's is, the yield and profit is being taken and the yield is being taken. You can see the size of the plant. I will show you the plant and the plant. For this Srikandha, everytime we say, Choguchha is one of the best hosts. One is the plant and the other is the plant. You can see, our plant has completely flowered. It has bloomed completely in one year. The growth is very fast. The maturity level is high. Then, the reference of this garden is here. Look at the size of the plant. Look at the plant. It is completely round. The size and color. It is not like a regular chemical spray. It is not like a regular chemical spray. It is like a fungal related spray. We are only taking this for the disease that comes from the fevamsha. There is more fevamsha. I am saying that there is more fevamsha. When the plant is in the garden, the surrounding, the plants grow here, more water is released here, and when the water is released, the fevamsha grows in the normal way. We can see the fungal relativity here. We can see the fungal infection in the other plants. But, another highlight of this plot is that all the plants have even growth. Look at this. All the plants have even growth. To achieve even growth, I always say that mother plant is very important. If you have collected seeds, how you have developed the plant in the nursery, I am talking about Srikandha. From this mother plant, you can achieve even growth of sandalwood. Otherwise, your growth will be small, big, and chances are very low. I am collecting fruits here. Minimum 400 grams plus. You can see Srikandha here. To achieve even growth, I told you about seeds and host. When we give the seeds properly, you can also plant a beautiful garden. If you are nearby, from the Belgaam district, if you want to go to this garden, you can go to Hidikkal. I will give the number of this place. If you contact us, you can go there, develop the garden, share your opinion in the comments, and then what other friends will do there is how to get yield, what are the procedures, we will be making another video about that. Every year, from 1 to 1.5 lakhs, they collect it in one time. Every year, from 2 to 3 lakhs, they collect it from just coriander. This is for everyone to know, and for the benefit of everyone. We will make a video for that. Look at this plant, it is so healthy and green. Look at the size of all the plants, look at the color, the shape of the leaves, friends, it is the same. Because, from our Dharvit, if you have developed it in this plantation, it will be even aged. Then, it will grow in growth rate. From our plant, it will be 2 to 3 rupees more expensive. But, from our plant, if you don't get any service, if you get any feedback, to develop a beautiful garden, that 2 rupees is not a big deal. Because, if you have 15 years of experience, and 8 years of knowledge, and if you have 1 to 2 rupees less, please inform your friends. Contact the number on the screen, and if you need information, you can contact. Now, our farmer will tell you, please come and see. Namaskar sir. What is your name? I am from Kedang.

aud Back to healer It is a parasite. It cannot generate its nutrients. It can absorb nutrients from other trees. Now you may not have trees nearby. But there are lots of weeds here. That is why it has its nutrients. But according to our demonstration, where we have planted the seedlings, the seedlings will survive. It will give good nutrients to the weeds. It is non-irrigation. Is the distance too much? No, if you put it too much, it is one or two feet. If you go to the forest, the weeds are not far away. The roots are half a foot away. The roots should be locked. It will survive. After 18-20 years, due to the diversity of crops, you will get different crops. You can grow agricultural crops here. You can grow oilseeds here. But after 18-20 years, the roots will become permanent. But we don't say that it is the only plant. We don't have a host plant. We don't have anything to hold the roots. We want to plant a plant in the diversity. We want to plant 50-60 plants in one acre. This is the food forest. We want to have food and forest. We get wood for the forest. It helps nature. We want to have food. We have three varieties of seed. This is red and that is golden. This is gold. This is peanut butter. What we think of these plants is... Look at this tomato. This is a seed. This is a natural pulse. Tomatoes are grown here. Farmers use it for growing trees. Tomatoes can grow 10 tons. But when we grow only one, we get food and food. We need to have a long-term and short-term crop. When farmers retire, they can plant only the seeds and the seeds. This is a 30-year crop. It has been five years. It has been two years since then. We need to have a host plant ecosystem. Roots should be there. We need to grow more trees. This is called... Is it native? No, it is not. It is our own soil. Thank you for watching.

 So, the first question is, if you say that it is a tree of Sri Gandha, it is definitely different from other trees. What is the difference between this tree and other trees? That is our first question. If we talk about the tree of Sri Gandha, it is not like a normal tree. It is a hemiroot parasite. It is a tree that has been developed after the pervavvalambi. The special thing about this tree is that the heartwood is developed very well from fine grains. The color of the tree is very special. The heartwood is developed in the first ten to seven years and the oil of Sri Gandha is prepared and deposited in it. So, Sri Gandha is good for the Parimala and it has a medicinal value. It has medicinal properties. It has medicinal properties and Parimala. It is good for the good health of the trees. It is good. That is the specialty of Sri Gandha. The first question that came to our mind was that we should have a Sri Gandha tree. We wanted to have the first one, the Sashi tree of Gunnamotta. Where do we get these Sashi trees? The Sri Gandha Sashi trees are grown in our nursery. In the Sashi Palanalai in the Aruniyalaki area. This year we have grown more than 6 lakh trees. We have grown them and the people have grown them. The farmers have grown them. Yes, they have grown them. This year almost all the trees have been empty. In our nurseries, in Sashi Palanalai, we don't get them now. But next year, this year we have given a lot of importance and enough publicity. But the demand is very low. There is a lot of demand. There is a lot of demand. So, I think this year we have grown 6 lakh trees. For the next year, we are growing more trees. We are growing more trees for the next 10 lakh trees. We have planned it. We have planned it. Now we have a call. Nagraj has called from Pawgad. Hello, Nagraj. Hello, sir. We are calling from Pawgad. Nagraj, please ask the question. How much trees can we grow in Sriganmura? The question was the same, Nagraj. Now, how many feet should we make a tree in between? Nagraj, we can make a tree in between 10 feet. When the tree is in between, you can decide the height. It will be different depending on the height. It will be different depending on the height. It will be around 400-435 feet. How do you make the soil suitable for that? The soil is actually, we call this as Lomi soils. Lomi soils, well-drained soils, best for this Sriganmura. But it has come in all kinds of clay soils. It is also growing well in sandy soils. I have seen it in the Gurbharg. Even in black cotton soils. It is growing well in all kinds of soil. Another question is from Chitradurga. Kiran has done the work. Hello, Kiran. Hello, sir. Kiran, please ask the question. Sir, now we are in Chitradurga. Please ask the question. Being an M.L.C. graduate, B.Sc. B.Sc. Forestry graduate. Please speak a little louder. I am also a B.Sc. Forestry graduate. Is it? If you are able to speak in your own language, then it will be fine. It will be fine. But actually, we have a soil called Chavad Bhoomi. It is not suitable for shooting there. Chavad Bhoomi is not suitable there. As you said, there may be a camp there. There may be a camp there. There may be a camp there. There may be a sandal there. But Chavad Bhoomi is not suitable. It is not suitable. Now we have reached the end of the B.Sc. We are going to start the conservation project. We have to get it out in a good way. What kind of conservation projects should be done in the initial stage? We are also going to give the Srikantata forest 8 inches by 12 inches in bags. We are going to make pits for it two by two feet. We are going to make a full forest in the Farmers' Agriculture Land. We are going to make ploughing there. Initially, we are going to give the compost coconut to the well-rotten farm yard. We are going to give it to each one of them. It will grow well. It will grow well. Along with that, we are going to give the host plant. That is very important. Yes, it is important. What kind of fertilizer can be used for this plant? It is enough if you use a seed. It will grow well. There is another one called Hongunna Soap. You can use it after cutting the soap. Here, we have Khajurina, a kind of a windmill. A windmill will grow well. Now, some people grow Hebbia in the inter-plant. That is also good. In the inter-plant, this is called Dhanimbe. Dhanimbe is also a good host. We can grow all these different types of trees as a plant. We can grow them. Now, even the clean white ones, like these, we call them weeds. These are the stones. Yes, the stones. There can be grasses. Those are also good hosts. There is another question. Madhusudan from Shirad has asked this question. Greetings to Madhusudan. Greetings sir. Yes, ask the question. Sir, we are planning to go to Srikanth. For that, what kind of rules are there? Regulations rules, protect... This is a good question, Madhusudan. How is the government's rules now? Now, we should take some measures in the context of the nation. Because there was a rule that it should not be exposed. These things have been studied. Greetings to Madhusudan. There is no restriction for the opening of Srikanth. There are no rules or regulations. There is no restriction. There was no restriction at first. Even before that, Srikanth was a state tree. It was a government property. At that time, in the land of Kasagi, in the house, in the place, if there was any tree, that tree was the government property. But when it was mature, we built it. Even then, when we built it, that was our depot, Sandalwood, Arunela, when we took it to Srikanth's fort, we used to dress it there. We dressed it and there was a bell in each part. We put the bell and we give 90% of that bell in total value to the farmer. Before we used to give, today it is the same. But at first, Srikanth's house was the government property. Now, we have completely destroyed it. It is in some place, it is his property. So, there is no restriction. There is no restriction. We can leave Srikanth's house. We can leave the trees. Now, another question. Ashok has done this. Ashok, greetings. Greetings, sir. Ask the question. We are talking from a distance. Ask the question. Sir, can we leave in Vanabheshaya? Can we leave in Vanabheshaya? We can leave, but we have to stay in the original place. In Vanabheshaya, the growth of Srikanth is good. In the south, moisture is good, sunlight is good. In Vanabheshaya, we don't normally say that we will drip the water. In South Karnataka, in South Karnataka, the sunlight is good. If we put it in the trees, it is enough. If we put it in the trees, the sunlight is good. Some people put it in the trees, but not in the forest. Some people drip water, some people don't. The sunlight is good. In the north, in the northern districts, I have seen in Gulbarga, in the villages, if the main crop is irrigated, then we get some sunlight. The sunlight is good there too. Sir, another question. For how many years will this be suitable for Maratha? I have told you that it is suitable for Maratha. From 10 years, actually, there is a brown color that is called as hotwood. It starts like that. From then, it is sold as Maratha. For 10 years, you can get 1-2 kg hotwood. For 15 years, it is different. It is not that much. It can be a little more. It can be a little more. It can be a lot more. Hotwood formation is not good there. It is very good there. It is medium, average. We can recognize that. If it is there, it is like an auger. If you put it and see, you will know how much white it is. Then we will know that it is in some range. For 15 years, it can be 4-5 kg to 10 kg. For 20 years, it can be more. It can be more. It is more and more as the years pass. It is more and more. Hotwood is burning. It is getting more hot. Hotwood is also burning inside. If you put it in more water, the fire will burn and the hotwood will be less. That is very important. So, we don't need much water. It is a good fire for the dry season, but it is slow. For the rainy season, we can think about harvesting. We can think about harvesting. There is another question. Hanum Reddy from Kopala has asked this question. Hello, Hanum Reddy. Hello, sir. I am Hanum Reddy from Kopala. What is the question, Hanum Reddy? Sir, we have two lands, Masarani and the other. What we are going to do is, we are going to go to the rain-based areas, to the forest-based areas. There is a lot of discussion about that. The gentleman was saying that we can go to the forest-based areas. Where can we go to the forest-based areas? He is asking if we can go to the two lands. Can we go to the two lands? Yes, we can go. We can go to any land. But we cannot go to the two lands. There is another question. Samartha from Sagar has asked this question. Hello, Samartha. Hello. Hello, Samartha. Ask the question. Sir, how much is this? And is it too much to plant? What is the problem? That is a good question. There is a plant that saves the water. What are the procedures to save the water? Some people plant it in the forest. Some people plant it in the forest. In the area? Yes, in the area. There are people who plant it in the area. They say that when it is 7-8 years old, it will come out. Since then we keep it in the forest. We keep it in the forest at night. They say that we keep it for those who have gun license. Actually, the issue is that the plant that is called as the white-bearded tree has value. It is found outside. It is not in our bank locker. We have kept the important things outside. We have kept it outside. The forestry is like that. All the trees, small trees, are outside and we have to keep them. Some people have to make a compound or a belly. Actually, our sandal estates, we have belts like this. We put a fence in them. We put a chain link mesh. We have a huge amount of it, like 100 hectares. We put a fence in them. It will be natural. We have dogs and watchtowers with it. We have done all these things. We have done all these things. We have done all these things. We have done all these things. We have done all these things. But what are we doing now? We are doing something. We are doing something. The central government has shown interest in it. They have come and seen what we have done. They have seen how we have built with the farmers. And in our area, we have implemented the sandal estate concept. They have come and seen it. They have come and seen it. They have come and seen it. We have to implement the sandal estate concept like coffee, tea and coffee estates. This time, we have another work. Aruna has done his work. Aruna, Namaskar. Yes, sir. Where can we get sandal estate? We have a village in Gundlupet. Gundlupet. What about the sandal estate developers? We get sandal estate developers in the sandal estate development. Not only sandal, we get sandal developers related to sandal. There is a lot of sandal there. But this year, we have got sandal. In the last three years, they have taken sandal from us. We have implemented the agriculture and agriculture project in Riyadhidhar. How much is one sessi? One sessi is one rupee. If not, it is three rupees. That's it. We spend twenty rupees from 17 to 20 rupees for the construction of the sandal. How can we get the sandal estate in the same way as the sandal? You mentioned the ten sessis. How can we get the sandal with different sessis? Some people get it with papaya. It is good. I saw in Kolar, they did it with flour. Then, I said dalimba. Dalimba is very good. In Kolar, the sandal is very good. In between. It is very good. Good plants. Due to the drought, in the next period, it is possible to get more sandal. Yes, we can get more sandal. That is crown on top. What is it called? We call it crown. When it touches another tree, it becomes a competition. It is a competition for the wind. It is not a problem until it touches the tree. When it comes, in my area, we do it in alternate rows. We can harvest it. For around fifteen years, if we get the first harvest, I have not mentioned it, from four to five kg to ten kg, one tree. It is said that the first seed is grown in one way or another. Yes, it is the first seed. Even today, we have to do the cost for the government. In Arunelake, there is a sandal factory. They make soap and detergent. Mysore sandal. They make soap. Their factory is there. Here, handicrafts. For the handicrafts. They can do the work. They can buy it from the government. They buy it from the government. The farmers are growing this thing. The power is being lost. We are trying to get rid of the time and the time is running out. To make this event happen, to make this event happen, I would like to tell a few things to Sridhar Punati. One point. I would like to say one thing. In my opinion, we are trying to make the soil in some fields to be social. In some fields, we have planted in seven fields. So, when we plant in the fields, we collect all the waste. In the Kaisur Siddhi, this program will be successful. Please contact them and tell them what small things we should do. I would like to thank all the farmers in Sridhar Punati.

The soil, water and environment are the most important elements of the world. These are the physiological factors like soil, water and climate. Sri Gandha is the only place in the world where there is a lot of water. The National Health Organization has given a total of 22,000 aid to one acre of land. Sri Gandha is not a cheap water supply. We will make 3,000 rupees per acre for the soil. We have to go through the forest to reach Sri Gandha. As you know, it is basically a semi-root parasite. This is a problem. We need to find another way. We can say that we will be able to study Sri Gandha for the next 20 years. We can say that we will be able to study Sri Gandha for the next 20 years.

We have heard that the government is paying more taxes. We have heard that the government is paying more taxes. 15 years ago, after the war, Srikandu was going to be a good heartwood. He said that 15 years is needed. Before that, Srikandu was not like that. He said that 15 years is enough to get the profit.

When we have an open market, even if we have to do the government's work, when we have an open market, we feel the price is rising. What is the export rate of the land that is being used for the construction of the dam? We don't know much about that. They say that the construction of the dam is being used for the construction of the dam. We have heard that they are giving a lot of money to the poor in China. We have heard that they are getting a lot of money in Australia. But we don't know much about the export rate here. Some hills have had constructionóst来了. In the past, we were using the tire relative to air uncon boy friend. But we take bad copy of this model and take their job. It's a good thing. Apart from that, everything is going well. You mentioned about the seed. How long will it take to grow the seed? Seeds will grow in 3-4 years. After that, when it's ready, we'll shake it. After shaking it, we'll get the buyback system.

We've planted it in the old places. There is a hole here to collect the seeds. Is there any problem with jamming? The last time the bunch broke off the dust. Maybe after some hydbees break this fence and come back up the plant will be safe because the medicine has already been used and then we have to put up with the problem even if the hunger count is just a little lower if the plant takes care of itself and itbone woke up is our opinion When he was a Shrikanth, he used to be a shaman or whatever, but now he is a monk. Do you think it is better to give him alms? It is better to give alms. It helps the poor, it helps us in our life. So I think it is better to give alms and give Shrikanth. We have created Shrikanth in the Chepa Gita. When this Chepa Gita was built, we had a construction project for the Kuri Shedda. What is the problem with the Shrikanth? In our experience, it is better to take alms from the government. I think Shrikanth will give me alms. He has made the Aranayalaki from the Tarsi Beaches of Kerala. It is a good business. When we get alms, we take it from other places. But it is not a good business. There are some people who have taken alms from other places. It is not a good business. Do you have a waiting period for the government? They usually book alms in June. They take alms in July and August. I have a subsidy for the Sasi. The cost of the Kasi nursery is high. They charge 50 rupees for the construction of the dam. We have taken alms here. We have taken alms for the small amount of money. But the quality of the dams is not good. It is better to take alms here. Do you need permission to go out from the government? We have entered the government in the water. They have given the government a headscarf and a handkerchief. They have come and taken photos. They have entered in the water. We are also using the government's authority. We need the government. We need 20 years. We need to join hands with the government. We are doing it at home. Do you need the government's permission to go out from the government? No. We need the government's permission. We need to get permission to go out. We are doing the same. If we get the government's permission, we will get the government. We will get the government. We need the government to protect us. I think it is a good thing. We have been doing this for a long time. We have been doing this for a long time. We need to open the market. We have done this for a long time. We need to do this for a long time. Do you need the government's permission to go out? The government has given permission. The government has given permission. We can go out. We don't need the government's permission. If we go out, we will have to fight the government. We need the government's permission. We will fight the government. That is our hope. The people in Pani are saying that Shri Ganda is going to be the subsidy. Will the government give the subsidy? We don't want the subsidy. But we have the government's permission. We are fighting for it. We have the government's permission. We have the government's permission. We have the government's permission. We have been doing this for a long time. I was asked in Kerala. Since we have been doing this for 3 years, we have been given the subsidy. I feel that everyone should do this. Because Shri Ganda is a beautiful country. It is a famous city in Karnataka. I feel that everyone should fight for it. The government has permission. We can fight it. We believe that the government should fight for it. We believe that there is no problem in doing this. We believe that there is a way. Some farmers are already getting profit from this. We want to do this. When all the farmers are getting profit, the cost of the land is less. When there are only few farmers, the cost of the land is more. All the farmers should understand this. They should understand that the land is not good. I am afraid of living without remove closed quarters. I am afraid of living here continue to live in such areas. There won't be culture divide here in the future. People will not have fear ever of removing closed Absor modification. People have refused because of the Danish acreage. Just before you, in Namaraj, had we confided Shri Ganda at here, we were told to build beautiful forest and plant these. Over here, Bayasur and typical of Bangalore lies this. Looks like there will be good mention of this lake.

They will spray pesticides on the trees We should have water that is full Because when we spray it inside, we should use perfume, scent, oil We should use chemicals When we use oil, does it become chemical or pesticide? It becomes pesticide Can we use organic fertilizers? I have not used nitraryfixing tree, I have used other one Can we use inorganic fertilizers? What is inorganic fertilizer? It is used for the first initial stage of the establishment When the soil is less, the bear spreads and the other bear is not able to eat nutrients The plant suffers from this When the soil is less, the bear is not able to eat nutrients The plant suffers from this 50-100 grams of soil is used to grow It is not enough to grow a meter or 50 cm We use coconut to make a trench We use water to make a trench The soil gets heated The bear gets heated The water gets heated The water gets heated Coconut is not that hot The soil gets heated But after that, when the soil is less, the formation of hardwood starts When the formation of hardwood starts, we check it If someone asks, how is the formation of hardwood? How do you know that it is formation of hardwood? Normally, if the hardwood is not formed in sand, it will keep on getting and it will not become smooth When the hardwood starts, it starts to crack When the hardwood is full, it starts to crack The first clue is that the hardwood is not formed After that, you use an increment borer to check Now, we have a machine called Electrodes de Toma We use that and we pass a small current through the wood We pass the current through the wood After passing the current, the current moves through the wood We capture it and put it in the computer We know that it is a hardwood and not a hardwood Now, we will do it We will give a small template We will give a small template We will use an invasive method, non-damaging and non-destructive method After 6 years, 8 years, we should check the hardwood We should check carefully What should we do if the hardwood is not formed? Someone might say that the hardwood is not formed after 8 years But, it is scientifically proven that we should induce the formation of hardwood But, generally we say that Why do we use this Srikandha Marana? Why do we use this Srikandha Marana? Generally, we say that Why do we use this Srikandha Marana? Why do we use it in a place where the base is low or the soil is low? Because it gives different stress What happens when stress is given? The hardwood starts inside There is a bill and some literatures are written But, we don't know how to stress it The stress is the reason for the formation of hardwood What we do is We disturb the root area We touch the root If we disturb it, the formation of hardwood will be compromised Water will be reduced It will be more whistly All these things induce the formation of hardwood But, we haven't got any correct literature proof We should listen to the other side Usually, when we go to dry land, the formation of hardwood is faster It has more oil percentage If you go to the Malar Chimmanu, there is a lot of vegetative growth Hardwood is less in the north Or, in the south, the oil percentage is less This is the way we do it We do it by listening This will also die by this year You know it, the house will also die The investors will prepare We should support this Any fruit trees, you can plant them in the local area You should have a plan This will be done by this year I am an astrologer, I will estimate the stock You should know it We will tell you the distance between 5 and 5 But, you should decide the distance between the 4 report and the 4 report If you go to Tiptur, the coconut trees will die in 20 feet If you go to Chimmanur, the distance will be less Do you understand? In Tiptur, the coconut trees will die in 20 feet If you go to Chimmanur, the trench will be filled with water I mean, the people will be able to control the situation And the people will be able to control the situation I am talking about the general situation Sir, you are not saying that it is a big deal If you can do something less, it is good You can do it for 4 or 5 or 4 You can decide it by yourself That is the important thing What happened? Did you do any protection? Did you come to the forest? Where did you come? How many years did you stay? 6 to 8 years Heartwood formation was initiated Heartwood formation was initiated and it was still there until 2015 You can say that you are still in the business of it You have more profit I am not saying that it is not there But you will be getting tight You will be getting tight for 3 to 4 months You will be getting tight You will be getting tight You will be getting tight That is why we are asking you for 15 years You can save at least 12 years You will get 10 kg of wood from the entrance You will get 10 kg of wood from the entrance Okay? After that you have to agree with KSDL You have to know the procedure of MOV After agreeing, they will come to your place They will go to the forest They will give an application to the forest department You have to give the filing permission I have done this What is this RTC? RTC RTC means entry I have entered from Sandalwood, Beledi You have to give the proof You have to give the proof They will give you the filing permission You have to give the filing permission They will go to the forest The forest department They will put the wood with moisture content on you They will give you a small amount of water They will put that water on you and dressing it They will dress it, put it in the forest They will put it in the forest They will see how much water comes from the forest It is a category They will give you a category They will multiply the categories Suppose you want 3 kg of wood If you have an average category, you will get Rs 6000 If you put it in the last category, it will be 12,000. That's what KHDO gives. There are many challenges. So for that, you should now make an association with the farmers and make a meeting with the farmers and discuss with the ministers last year in November and give such a classification that the people of Tipu are not able to get that system. We are not accepting that now. Because that classification has been made. The classification that is made for trees that are in the forest. In the country, the farmers are not able to get the trees or the trees that are in the forest. So, don't give this classification. Make four classifications. One is STEM, one is root, one is sap, one is dust and one is bark. Fix a rate for these four classifications.

 MUSIC I have come to a farm. In this one acre area, I will show you how much trees are planted, how they are fed, and how much profit is made from it. But before that, let's see the BMM farm. Tadaaaan! So this is the BMM organic farm. Here in this one acre area, 200 trees are planted. So let's see how it is done. Here, they have grown crops for water. If something happens to the water, it will help the farmers to get water from here. As you can see, there are many trees. The trees are very strong. The specialty of this farm is that the trees cannot be planted on their own. So, if you want to plant trees, you need to have a special plant. If you have a plant nearby, it will be alive because of the plant's energy. So, if you plant trees, you cannot plant them on your own. So, I want to support that. Only then, the trees will grow well, and your Srikandha tree will grow well. There are 15 varieties of trees in the world. But India has the Australian sandal. The Australian sandal has two sides. It is the best in the world. Especially, the Indian sandal is very expensive. So, we thought, if we do this agriculture, we will be very profitable. In 2001, we noticed that even if we plant trees, the government would have taken over. But now, the government wants to promote this. If you plant sandal, the Srikandha tree will grow well. But, the government will take over. So, even if you plant one tree, the government will not register it. But, you can grow this tree in your farm. If you do this as your children, usually, if you plant this tree for 30 years, you will get a lot of money. But, unfortunately, we are not taking any scientific methods. If we take all these, we will get good food. In 15 years, we will get that profit. In 30 years, in 15 years, in 30 years, we will get profit. So, now, we are seeing these trees in this farm. These trees have been planted for 2 years. So, it has been 2.5 years. It has been 3 years. We can see these mixed trees here. If you look at the trees that have been planted for 10 years, they have grown well. They will get at least 3 crore rupees. At least. Because, the rates will change. But still, when we cut the trees, we will get soft wood. That's why, there is not much of a difference. But, in the middle, there is a difference. If you have a tree that is 2 feet tall, you will get 70 to 80 kg of hard wood. But, the difference is very big. So, another thing is, our Karnataka oil is being used by the government to make our oil. Do you know how much it costs? 1 kg oil costs 5 lakhs rupees. Just imagine, half a gram of oil costs 2.5 lakhs rupees. One gram of oil costs 5 lakhs rupees. If you are doing this farming, you have to feed the tree for 1 to 2 years. Because, when you are young, it is difficult to grow a tree or a fungus. If you are just feeding it for 3 years, you will be able to grow a tree in 10 years. You will be able to live with a guarantee. If you are just feeding the tree, it will not grow. Because, it will only grow. So, you need to have another tree. You can use a host plant. The tree will start to grow slowly. The tree will grow slowly. The tree will grow slowly. The tree will grow slowly. The tree will grow slowly. The tree will grow slowly. The tree will grow slowly. It should have a single tree. You need to take care of one more thing. If you are just feeding the tree, don't feed it for more than 3 or 4 years. If you want to plant a big tree, you have to wait for at least 2 minutes. When you see the tree, you want to plant it. But before thinking about the tree, you have to think about the consequences. Planting the tree is not a big deal. It is a big deal to save the tree from the rocks. When the tree is in a situation to be cut, the rock is very strong. So your security system should be strong. You have to invest a little to make the tree grow. You can see the options for this. There are CCTV cameras, fencing, solar fencing. You can see the security measures. If you have two leaders, you can plan your area according to your budget. You have to save the tree from the rocks. If you plant the tree from the rocks, you will have to go through a lot of trouble. Another thing we see in advance is that the tree has a chip. The chip can be controlled by the forest department. So even if someone steals your tree, they will know where the tree is. How should we start the plantation? How should we start? What should be the security system? We have to first understand this. Then we have to know how to get the trees. How to feed them. How to get the trees for 6 to 7 months. We have to look at this carefully for 3 years. We will give you another benefit after the big one. We have to look at how to take care of it when it is small. We have to learn from each one. If you start this, you will have to cultivate it for at least 10 years. If you cultivate it for a good year, it will be a guarantee. In our Freedom Map, Sandalwood, Sri Gandha's organic farming course, they will start this. When they start, they don't have money. They change the money they earn to get land. They start this. They are very happy today. Another good thing is that this farm is their farm. Mangalamma is their name. I will tell you how they started, how their journey was, how much they spent, and how their life has changed in the next episode. So, this BMM farm was a practical experience for me. But how their journey was, how hard it was to start this farm, and how they are happy. If they start this, they will be a millionaire. They will get the award they want and get it no matter what. So, you too, after knowing their journey, if you want to do something, you should definitely do it. If you don't, you should definitely award it. It will be very profitable. So, I will see you in the next episode. Till then, take rest. Don't miss an episode. If you miss this series, you will be in a loss. Bye-bye. .

 Namaskar Friends, today we are going to show you another important thing. We are going to show you how important is host and light for Srikant. Here our friend is showing you this. This is Srikant's 7th year. We have given host to this. This is not for maintenance, it is for the hostel. When we have host, you can see the surroundings. But the house on the right side is not a host. If you see the surroundings, the growth is very good. We have not given anything to this. It is just a natural house. If you see on the right, there is no host. See the growth difference. There are two 8 times built houses. If someone comes to this place, many people will know this place. We will show you more. You have to see what happens when you come in the sun. There are many walls in front of our hostel. But the walls that we have built are all single. But the growth is less. Why is this less? Because the main thing is that the sunlight is not getting properly. We will show you the same house in both the houses. The sunlight is getting and going up. But it is going around. It is going up fast. Because it is in competition. It is in the excitement of the need of light. This house is a light demanding house. So it does not get damaged. It goes up fast. People show that it is 10 feet, 1 year old and 20 feet old. It is not useful. It does not matter how high it goes. It should come around. Because the ratio of hot wood depends on the top. 30 to 70. You can see here. There are small walls. It is more than 6 feet. But it does not go around. Because it is in the under shade. Many people put it with 5 feet of mahogany. 450 mahogany and 450 srikand. Not one acre. 900 walls put in one acre. The children. I would like to say to them. Come and see our garden. Otherwise stop giving wrong information. Because the farmers are getting bad. I have no profit from this. We are telling them good things. We will give the sashi. But we are giving it less. One idea is to get good quality for the farmers. If you give good quality and if not, stop giving. Tell us that we do not know. Do not change everything. We should not take our lives to change your sashi. I am requesting you. If you have any problem with us. If you feel like we should not tell you. If you are not in college. You can ask us. We will see what we can do. You can change your sashi. Okay friends. Stay away from the hunter. Namaskar.

で ProductionPreferences Filmmaker Anchor No matter how an actor- ah! who achieved successopposing an Globe O Kindern all those grafts will face the samef They have been producing the same material for a long time. So, till now, the Srikand has been standing on the ground. So, the Srikand is very expensive. Some industries depend on the Srikand's price. They are not doing their own plantation. I will tell you about the Panparag industry. In Mandhya Pradesh, there is a small place. They do their own plantation there. They do their own business. They do Panparag. So, the Panparag industry is based on the need to grow a crop. The Srikand's oil is used to grow crops. Otherwise, the crop is not grown. So, the Srikand's oil is used to grow crops. That is why the Srikand's oil is called as Fixity. The Srikand's oil is needed because of that property. They are growing their own plantation. So, in Karnataka, the Srikand is known to other countries. They are growing their own plantation. They are growing their own plantation. They are growing their own plantation. They are growing their own plantation. They are growing their own plantation. They are growing their own plantation. They are growing their own plantation. They are growing their own plantation. They are growing their own plantation. They are growing their own plantation. They are growing their own plantation. They are growing their own plantation. They are growing their own plantation. They are growing their own plantation. Why is that ? If we compare the Srikand's oil to Srikand's oil, we should know the economics of Srikand. Because, in Srikand, we have more challenges. What is it ? We know the seedlings, how they grow and how they grow. We should cover the color of the soil. We should study the damage of Srikand. We should study the damage of Srikand. We should do the right marketing. We should do the right marketing. We should do the right marketing. When we see such a challenging crop, when we see that other crops are better than this, and we get a good price, we should know how much this costs. If we know how much this costs, if we have a way, we should take a decision to buy that or buy something else. Economics of sandal is very important. When we talk about economics of sandal, if we look at the complexity of sandal, we can understand how much salt is there. The reason for challenging sandal is that it is not just one seed. If we want to grow another crop, we need to call it an alternate host. It is grown in different stages and in different trees. So it is a bit challenging. If we understand all these complexities, then economics will be understood. First, the price of sandal is high, then the price of sandal, then the price of sandal, and then the price of the other host. There is a lot of growth in this. So economics will also vary. So selection of the other host is also important. And then decision making. Decision making is important in every stage. If you make a decision in any stage, you can observe the changes in the changes. I will tell you about that in the next lesson. These are all different crops. Just like the one we planted in Gendipatta, there are a few. This is called Shivni. It was grown in Andhra Pradesh. It is called Sri Gandhiji. But we have not received any papers or thetas from this. So we are not saying that it is grown or not. This is called Shivni. It is a small tree. It is a tree that is very tall. It is not a tree that can be dripped. It is a tree that can be dripped. It is a tree that can be dripped. It is a tree that can be dripped. It is a tree that can be dripped. It is a tree that can be dripped. It is a tree that can be dripped. It is a tree that can be dripped. It is a tree that can be dripped. It is a tree that can be dripped. It is a tree that can be dripped. With regards to where economics can fail, is something that I have ready in the goal. First, we must choose a location, place to demolish the earth. We must consider that area. See that area that we need to see. Now as you can see we can see that in the sand, there are two sides to it. What do we do first? To punish the sand that taped out of sand is we examine if the land is not polluted. That is something that we can If you have a pH of 7.5 to 7.5, it is safe. pH means we have reduced the concentration of hydrogen ion. That's the thing. You understand? We have reduced the concentration of hydrogen ion. That pH is very important. Why? Because if the pH is of any imbalance, the plants cannot move properly in the soil. The plants cannot absorb the soil properly. If the pH is neutral, absorption and exchange of ions is done correctly in the soil. The soil cannot move properly. That's why we have reduced the pH. We have reduced the organic carbon content. The organic carbon contains as much carbon as the ion. If the organic carbon content is good, the oxygen content will be high. If you have absorbed enough nutrients, you can take it and supply it to the soil. That's why we have reduced the pH. After the soil test, they say that the soil is neutral. You can grow the seed in this soil without any problem. We have done the research. We have selected a seed for the next month. After checking the selected seed, we have done the land preparation. The land preparation is done. The land preparation is done by the use of more stones, stones and stones. The land has been used, so you can useful. After bettering the expenses, the plants need to be maintained. For this the usage SOLIDELY prepared the land, Sesame seeds, tap rhythm, pruning etc., have much efforts ability. When you select the seeds, the lands will suffer from smaller expenses. It will be個 Nvidiaroyalap United Sh paint. Selection of land is very important. slope, water should flow cleanly Now your land is ready, you have to do planting You have given the slope, you have to do land preparation After land preparation, next question comes What should we do next? First we have to do, after land preparation is done, we have to do pitting We have given 11 meter slope, we have done 11 meter slope, we are ready We are going to do pitting After pitting, we have to go to forest department, give application Sir, I have done this much of work, in this subsidiary, I have raised crores of rupees If you give me any evidence, it will be ready You have to do planting in June, you know that, the month starts in June You have to do planting So before planting, do pitting When to do pitting, how to do pitting, at what distance to do pitting Why to do pitting? These questions come to mind Right? To do pitting, I have to cut the grass Usually we recommend to cut the grass at 45 cm, 45 cm and 45 cm One row, one row, one row, cut the grass Why to cut the grass one row, one row? Because one row, one row grass is there, correctly to the seedling, the earth, the sassi That size of pitting is correct To do pitting, at what time to do pitting? Question mark, right? If I have to do planting in June, Should I do it one month before or three months before? Question mark Whenever you have to do pitting, you should not think about doing pitting in January, February Why? Because in January, February, winter ends, the base starts From March, April, full base What happens in that base? You have not given the pitting, right? When you do pitting, the soil is exposed to the sun's rays The sun's rays are visible on the soil, right? When the hill is built, when the hills are there, it is visible One row After pitting, I have to do it three times First, the topsoil, 15 cm topsoil, that is the ground of the field The ground of the field is taken one side, the ground coming down is taken the other side Next, when the hill is built, in February, March, the hill is built After a few days, the soil is dry and the soil is separated Next, planting is done To do the planting, we have to remove the plastic cover from the seedling After removing the plastic cover, we have to put the seedling After putting the seedling, when the hill is built, the soil is removed from the ground After removing the plastic cover, you have to put the seedling in the farm yard For one box of 2 kgs, 3 kgs, you have to put the seedling in the farm yard If the seedling is not mixed with the soil, the water holding capacity will be high When you do the planting, you have to do the flood irrigation for the seedlings For the seedlings to grow well, you have to do the flood irrigation When you start planting in June, one rain will fall, another will come and you will not know If you do not take this risk, you will grow well with the first seedling If you grow well with the second seedling, you will grow well with the third seedling

 Hi, Namaskar. Today I am going to share a good topic. Microchip. For women, it is for protection. Everyone has a problem, everyone has a dream. How to protect their smell, how to make profit from it. I will tell you how to install the chip, how much it costs, when to install it, how long it takes. I will give you a complete description of how to install the battery. Come and see. If you haven't subscribed to any other channel, please subscribe to the channel. Share this video in your groups. Because this information, or this information, is being given in different ways. It can be in newspapers or in other articles. That is, I will buy this chip and go. Tell me what this chip will do for me. I will give you a complete description of it. Come and see. If you see here, this is a lot that we have already installed the chip. That is, prototype. This is being tested for the chip. But when the testing is done, this chip is being used to make a mesh for the walls you see here. This is a wall that has been here for about 18 to 25 years. This is the wall that is being installed. For this, they are putting a chip here and giving protection. That is, testing is done. But they have installed a mesh here. Why have they installed a mesh? Because someone is trying to get this wall to work. This is one of the protection. If you put a mesh here, it will not be able to work. That is why they have installed this. Then why have they installed it from 5 to 8 feet? If you ask, the smell is only 5 feet from the other. The other one is completely full of smell. Then the wall is not working. That is why they have installed this. This is the same as the other one. This is the same as the other one. This is the same as the other one. The smell of the wall is only 5 feet above the ground. That is why you get a hardwood. What you see there is a small memory chip. That is a security chip. In common terms, security chip is a small one. It works as a security chip. But this chip is the most expensive. The price of this chip is 500 to 800 rupees. For today's price, it can be less. But what I am saying is, If you put a chip here, it will be visible to the eye. If it is visible to the eye, how can it be protected? The question is very important. Now I will tell you in detail. If the voice is not correct here, There is a sound issue. We are recording this again. Here you can see the wall. This is a 8 year old wall. This is a chip. This is another type. This is the size of the chip. The size of the chip is 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches. This is in the shape of a wall. The chip is visible. It will come in the same shape and color. That is because it is a camouflage. It is a kind of camouflage. It is a camouflage that is a camouflage. It is a camouflage that is a camouflage. But it is visible to the eye. It is not a big deal. What we did in the prototype is, 8 feet. I put this chip in a 8 feet long stick. I put this chip in a 8 feet long stick. What this chip does is, When the vibration is too strong, When the vibration is too strong, When the vibration is too strong, When you cut it from the stick, What sound will come? When you put it from the machine, It creates a vibration. It will give you an alarm. It will give you an alarm. It will give you an alarm. When you give an alarm, Will you come and hit the color or try to hit it? Will you come and hit the color or try to hit it? If you don't come and hit the alarm, See how much protection you can give. Now after hitting the alarm, After hitting the alarm, Why does the stone stick to the stick? Why does he stick to the stick? He has a stick in his eyes. We put it in the hole. He needs it. There is a number there. He will take it out and stick it in the hole. He will take it out and stick it in the hole. He will take it out and stick it in the hole. Now how can you trace the chip? Now how can you trace the chip? So chip is not that reliable. So chip is not that reliable. If I close my eyes and put the chip in the hole, It will be completely lost. What do I do for that? Many people think so. If I put a chip in it, it will be no problem. This is one. The second problem is, One day, the companies came from Mysore and said, One year, I will take 80 rupees and take the wall. I will come after a year and put a chip in it. They put a chip in the first wall, and after 8 years, they don't come to put the chip in the wall. They don't come to put the chip in the wall after 8 years. The wall will be small. They are all fake companies. I will come after a year and give you free fencing. I will give you 50 rupees from the previous year. I will give you free chip after 2 years. These are all fake. This company is a fraud. No one is coming from Mysore. That's why I am telling you. If you want to do such a plantation, you have to take your responsibility. You have to take your responsibility. Don't give your responsibility to anyone. Don't give your responsibility to anyone. Don't give your responsibility to anyone. When your dreams, your land, your money, when all this is yours, why do you have a major concern? Security, if someone dies, if someone believes, that is my request. This cost is 500 to 800, this cost is 5 to 8 lakh rupees per acre. Again, another problem. I will tell you that. Another problem is, every 3 years, you have to change the battery. The battery cost is 50 to 70 rupees. If you change the cell, the cell will be the same as the watch cell. If you change the cell, life will be better. But as of now, to get out of the prototype, it will take 1 to 2 years minimum. If you want to give security to the body, you have to put a mesh on the border, then put a dog on the border, and then install an alarm system. Then install an alarm system. Then install an alarm system. Then install an alarm system. Then install an alarm system. What do the alarm sensors do? If someone is running at night, it will give you a signal, it will automatically start making sounds. I have done all this, and I hope you liked this video. If you have any questions, please leave a comment. Please subscribe to my channel.

 You have also grown plants. First of all my farm there was my uncle's farm In my uncle's farm, some is not coming even a few average plants So, when I asked them, they said I need to make a specialize try to grow it So, we started a farm in my brother This so far we have planted a tree Till now we have come here 7 years back! and now we are 7.8 years Some more times it is getting boring From there, the more host we give , the more the grandmother and father, 가 entwined The maximum used is just around From karnataka neighborhoods From Chamarajaesи nagara to kola or chikbalapura especially here in Srikanth, the oil content is high. Percent of sanitary is high. So, the belt farmers can pay attention to this. They can put something on the belt and wait for the rain to stop. They can put the belt on the belt and wait for the rain to stop. You have to put the belt on the belt for 3-4 years and wait for the rain to stop. It is not easy to grow corn. It takes 3 years to grow corn and then it rains. After that, you can grow rice. You can grow rice in a tractor for 3 years. You can grow rice in a tractor for 3 years. You can grow rice in a tractor for 3 years. What kind of corn do you need? You can grow corn in a pot. You don't need any other mineral. You can grow your own tea or other things. You can grow your own tea or other things. You can grow your own tea or other things. You can grow your own tea or other things. If you don't have enough water for the base, you can use one or two sacks of water. How long will the oil develop? According to the environment, some people ask for 10 years, some people ask for 15 years, some people ask for 20 years. If you get all the natural ingredients, you will get oil from 4-5 years. Oil will start to form from 4-5 years. I have seen in my garden that the oil has been formed from 4 years. But the oil content is very low. It has started from 4 years to form a hot wood. I have read in my book that it is formed naturally in our garden. It can take 15 years to form. Some people get it for 10 years, some people get it for 15 years. There is a difference between 10 years and 15 years. For 10 years, you can get 5 kg or 3 kg of tea. For 15 years, you can get 10 kg, 12 kg or 20 kg. You can see how the wood is for the morning, and you can see what you have done. The only thing is that the white ants, the gendarmes, they eat a lot of the earth. If you see them in a hurry, you will not find any other kind of plants. Is it suitable for red soil or black soil? Is it suitable for red soil or black soil? It can be suitable for all soils. But what is the oil content? Red loom is oil, or the earth is made of stone, small stones, and if there is red soil, it is very good. It is good for all. It is good for all. But oil content is more in these areas. What is the security? You have to take care of the security. No one else has come and taken care of it. So, you cannot do it. They just say that you can do this and that. Fencing and then do it. If you do it on a small scale, it will be very difficult. Because it is difficult to take care of everything by putting 500 to 1000 trees. Because the money you earn will be taken care of. For that, if the farmers do it on a large scale, 2000 to 3000 trees, usually 400 trees are put in the IDL. We have done it on a high density. We have put 600 to 700 trees. Now, comfort. That is a good method. There is enough land, even if it is dry land, to do it in 5 acres, what will happen? You can put all the money, the work, and it will be profitable. If you do it for 10 years, the seeds will come, the Srikandha seeds, they will come and give you 100 to 150 rupees per kg. From that, you will get profit. If you do it for 10 years, you will get profit. You can put 10 to 20 trees there, or you can put whatever you want, and you can get profit from that. What about the blood donation? We have 1000 blood donations in our village. It has been 8 to 6 years. We have not done a single plantation. Every year, during the rainy season, we do a plantation. We have been replanting the trees. We have all the stages in our farm. We have 4 to 8 years of trees. We do it every morning. We should do the same for everyone. If we do not do a single plantation, it will not grow. Then, you will not be able to reach the expectations you have. So, is there a silver rush in the soil? Yes, there is a silver rush. All the trees support that. There is no such host or such Allah. There may be more hosts. Nimbus, Mosambi, all these are very good hosts. C.B.A.s, all these. But, every tree is taken from the roots, and that is the host. There is no such species. There is no need for anything. There is no need for any kind of trees. So, when the trees come, the roots are taken from the roots? Yes, as I said, you can take the roots, and plant them, and open grazing the plants. Open grazing is not possible until 3 to 4 years. Because, every root, when it comes, it is eaten by the plant. If it is 5 to 6 feet high, after 3 to 4 years, you can open graze it. Is there any problem with the permission of the forest department? There is no problem. The forest department will supply you with trees for 3 rupees a month, and they will give you the amount you want. It is better to look at the good trees and buy trees from the good seeded trees. Don't go to the nurses and say that this is a tree, or that is a tree, and don't go to the nurses. You can buy the natural forest from the trees, and buy the trees from the trees. There is no need to say that you have cultured trees, and you can grow them fast. When the trees grow fast, the oil content is only shown. If you have cultured trees, you can grow them fast, but there is no oil content. Until now, there is no proof. There is no need to buy trees for 50 or 100 rupees. Just buy trees from the trees in the forest or in the nurses. You can buy trees for 1 or 2 rupees in the nurses. You can do that. Do that. Don't think about the cost of the trees and the cost of the trees. Just look at the trees and see if you can do that. Don't believe in that. Do your best. When you grow trees in parallel, you will get a guarantee for a bank deposit. When you grow 1000 trees, you can buy 500 trees. You can buy 100 trees from the white ants. You can buy 500 trees in 1000 trees and keep them for 15 years. You can do whatever you want in your life. Do you contact the nurses for saplings? We don't go to the nurses for saplings. We don't contact them. We don't touch them. You can ask the nurses locally. You can ask the government nurses or some places where you can trust them. We have Chintamani, Srinivasapura, Kolar, and other places. All the nurses have passed resolutions in the forest department. They want to do the same in every other nursery. If you ask all the forest departments, they will give you the information and guide you. You can ask them locally. Do you have any tips to prevent the cold? I don't know how many tips have been used to prevent the cold. I just want you to stay at home. That's the only thing that's important. If the government helps, the police helps, there will be no one at that time. So, do fencing and take care of yourself. If you have a dog or something, it's better to take care of yourself.

 Music Welcome to Kavishti! I am Vijayalakshmi Shibhar. We have all been standing still since the time the wild animals died. We have been living in peace, thinking that all the bad smell of our country will be gone. But let me tell you a story that will make us feel peaceful. In the Bangalore forest, they are trying to steal the smell of crores of rupees. But let me tell you a story. One day a distant forest came. It was a forest of the people who love the environment. They made a strange dream in our mind. That is, in the Bangalore forest of the world, crores of rupees are being stolen by the holy forest. They thought that they were making a cover story. At first, they thought that they were making fun. Because in a concrete forest like Bangalore, where should the smell of crores of rupees come from? But they worked hard and stole the wealth of the country. Please don't get angry and go to our house and open your eyes. After listening to their story, they started their journey to Jnanabharati. The people who love the environment welcomed us. They were excited and they took us to the Bangalore university campus. The forest here is in a very bad shape. The campus is in a very bad shape due to the plastic waste. The trees here have been destroyed by the wild animals. But we don't have any dry trees here. But we don't have any trees here. So, the sadness started to spread in our mind. But our sadness was gone when we entered the Jnanabharati temple. Because we were surprised here. We were surprised to see the views here. Here, the trees of the holy forest were destroyed. Yes, crores of rupees are being stolen here. You can get the trees of the holy forest from the temple. The dead trees are being destroyed. You can get more than 20 to 25 thousand rupees for a piece of wood. The pieces are being destroyed. If we take the big pieces of wood, there is no security. Sri Gandha is our pride. We call it the Kirti of Karunada. But the wealth of the forest is destroyed. The most valuable trees are being destroyed. The trees are being destroyed. The trees of the holy forest are being destroyed. They plant the trees in the night. They plant the trees in the night. There are so many trees there. You can see the trees there. But you can see the trees for a day or two. You can see the trees for a day or two. It's so nice. There is no place here. You can see the trees everywhere. There are so many trees. Is it? Yes. At one time, the Bengali people were living in the forest. This was a special property for the animals. They call this the holy forest. Because there were so many holy trees here. In the 80s, there were so many holy trees here. Sri Gandha was always full of holy smell. This is what the professor reminds us of every day. I came to this campus in 1983. Since then, there has been no holy tree here. There are so many trees here. There are so many trees here. I think the university should give priority to this. This is a smelly tree in Bangalore. We have protected the top priority tree. That's why the university is growing so much. It's growing so much. But now, the smell has spread in the smelly area. Sri Gandha is like a milk of stones. Every day, at least two to three trees are sacrificed for the stones. It's not a curse. The roadside is so bad. There are so many trees in the inside. I think that's why it's called a curse. There are even small walls. All of them are like a tree. They are cut down and left there. They are left for a week or two. Then they are cut down into small pieces and taken away. But the environment department of the biopark is trying to control the smell. The study accuses that they have come to the south and are trying to control the smell. It's so easy. We are standing on this road and there are so many street lights. They will hit us with stones when we are about to leave. There are 33 private security guards in Bangalore. They don't pay attention to this. If they hit us with stones, no one will listen. When we see the smelly trees in the forest, we get shocked. When we walk around the area, we see a clear sign. The stones are not cut down. They are cut down into small pieces and are being used as a tool. There is a machine. They use it to cut down trees in just two seconds. They use this machine to cut down trees. No one listens to us when we use the machine. When we see the machine, we feel like we have cut down 5 kg of trees. If we cut down trees, we will be involved in the problem. If we are involved, we can't do anything. There is a lot of smell in the forest. If we write that there might be a lot of dust in the forest, we will get a good answer. Because the smell of the trees has been removed by the stones. No one has been affected by this in the world. Today, they have done a different plantation. This valley is the valley from the first building to this building. They have done a sandalwood plantation in that region. It is coming out very well. They have cut down the trees. There is a committee called the Biopark Committee. They should replace the committee with sandals and sandals. They should get suggestions. If you see a bad person and steal the wealth that you have earned in your own house, you are in the deep sleep of the world. The family is sleeping in the hands of the dead. There is no information in the area.та Having dreamed of a microswitch, police force have stayed in bed. Are they also in their cooks? lets watch with the break now.

 But in the Jnana Bharatiya campus, 14 km away from the Vithanasavudha chamber, the Hindu householder Ashok is getting beaten up by his wife. But the government is holding hands with him. What is happening in the area next to us is that, the police and the police are being abused. They should be beheaded. Because no one can do this. That is why they are being beaten up. They should be killed. If they are not able to work, they should be sent to a department. If they are not able to work, then their work is a waste. They should be killed by their parents. If we are leaving them, then what is the use of calling them parents? They are orphans. The place where the criminals were seen, is not just a place. The police have kept them away from the area. But what is the answer to their legal efforts? There are 100 to 200 buildings. We have complained to the police. The police have told us to take them away. We have told the public that the police have told us to take them away. So many people are missing. We have checked the reality of their missing family. At midnight, we went to the VV campus. We ran in the place where the smell was. But no one asked us. From midnight, we ran around the campus for 6 hours. But we got a call from the Home Guard. When we spoke to them, we got to know some facts. We have no power to ride. We have no power to ride. We have no road. We have no station. We have no power to ride. We have no station. We have no power to ride. We have no station. We have nothing to do. Now we have to go back to the hostel. We have a lathe. We have to bring one of our own. We have a lathe. We don't need batteries. We don't need any equipment. But we have to send it to a place. If we don't have it on a cold day, that is okay. But if it is not on a cold day, I don't know what to do. That's my problem. I have given him a lot of money to build a house. He didn't give him a single torch. He didn't give him the right to study. So, he doesn't know when his eyes will come out. He doesn't know how he will be. He is in a state of not doing anything. After every two hours, they are wearing black dresses. They are watching us. They come to the bank. They come to the bank. A brother comes after 12 o'clock in the morning. Is he on a mission in the morning? No, he is there. He is there and he will see. He is there and he will see. A brother comes after 12 o'clock. I am here for work. When he comes, the machine will be cut and he will come. Madam, we have... Madam, I'm not getting out from the bus. He will come from Nayanalli. If you are a stone, what will they do? There are 63 home guards in Vishwavidyanile. What can they do? There are 5 entrances around Vishwavidyanile. But there are no check posts. During our reality check, police were checking vehicles. But they were not checking vehicles from Vishwavidyanile campus. Our country, our forest, our wealth, are not loved by the people. This is not possible for the society. These people are putting a board on the trees of Kilesakki forest. They are putting a board on the trees of Kilesakki forest. It is a crime to build these smelly houses. It is a duty to build and grow these houses. But the police and the university officials are forgetting their duty. The government should take a tough action against these officers. Otherwise, these smelly houses will be destroyed in the next day. I will be back with another news story. For Kshana Kshana Sudhi, this is Suvanna News 24x7. Thank you for watching. Kshana Kshana Sudhi

 Sri Gandhi and has made other objectives records based on his agriculture Even in the freedom Sir, we have seen the house. We are very happy. It is easy to think that we should do this. But when it comes to sadhana, it becomes a big problem. And there is a lot of situation behind it. When did you decide to do this? It was a long time ago in 2003-04 in our part. In Chikmangalur district, Tharikeera taluk. In that part, in 2006, Adikey Thota was built. After Adikey Thota was built, I was thinking of what to do in Malayasya. In Malayasya, there are big forest walls. If we want to build forest walls, we should build sagwani walls. Because my Adikey Thota was completely destroyed in the beginning. After Adai Thota was built, I was thinking of building a wall in Malayasya. I was thinking of building a teak house. With the teak house, we have permission to build a shrikhanda house in 2001-02. We knew that from the government. There was an advertisement that if we build a shrikhanda house in 2011, we will get 1 lakh payasam from the government in 10 years. I was thinking of doing that and building a wall in Malayasya. In 2005, I was thinking of building a shrikhanda house in my son's house. It's been 11 years now. I am very happy that I have built a shrikhanda house in my son's house for the last 15 years. I have made a profit of 1 lakh 80 thousand rupees. How many acres have you built? I have started with 4 acres and increased it to 44 acres. I have already explained how to save and save something in the Freedom App. They can see it and build it. You said that you are not going to tell the secret of success. You said that you have to save and build it. You said that you have to save and build it. Is that in the app? Yes, it is in the app. I have told the secret of success in the app. No one will tell the secret to their success. But the farmers have to do it. We have to build the shrikhanda house in Karnataka. Shrikhanda is very important in the world. I have told the secret of success in the app. I have explained everything in the app. It is difficult to do anything and it is very difficult to succeed. When you want to do something, you have to know the secret. If you want to do something, you have to be a guru and a guru in the future. There is no one in the past. There are many examples of white-collar farmers. There is the Freedom App. We will get the full information from it. We know the ways of building a dam. We know how to establish water for the dam. We know how to build coconut trees. We do everything manually and see things individually. If we do it fully, we are able to do it in one time. You must modify the license, how is that? There is no license from shrikhanda yet It is a experts license. If we want to build a car, we can build it. There is a big restriction from the government to build a car. According to the procedure, we will build it for Rs.2500. If we ask for permission, they will give permission. Now, the announcement has been made in the previous budget. In the 2021 budget, they are establishing Shrikanth's law. In the next 3-4 months, it will be introduced. If it is introduced, anyone can build it and build it anywhere. So, Shrikanth's law is not only for us, but for our country as well. No one will purchase tax from us. They will get a 32% tax, 18% GST, 18% forest development and 20% IT. 32% tax. In the non-marathon, they will get 22% tax from us. 10% supervision charges and 12% classification charges. 55% goes to the government. In the non-marathon, if I get 1 crore tax, the government will get 55 lakhs. It is difficult to build a forest. We can build a good forest around it. Good trees will get more air, more rain, more air pollution. Birds will get more air to build their nest. We can build our own forest. We can build more forest around it. Because no one has built a house for the birds. So, we can build a nest for the birds. Even the food is provided to the birds. We have a desire to build a good environment for the birds. So, I think everyone should be aware of this. We have seen in other countries that the profit is high, the loss is high. Is there any variation in this? Because of the rain, we have no effort to build a good environment. This is a kind of a good environment. It is not difficult to save the forest. The flooding is not a problem. Because in the world, the demand for the forest is high. In the open market, it is 30-50 thousand rupees per kg. So, the cost of the forest is higher than the cost of all the places. So, the loss is not a problem. When I did this, it was 1.5 billion per kg in 2005. Today, it is 12.5 billion per kg. Here, it is in the government rate. In the open market, it is 30-50 billion per kg. So, if the open market is more, the profit is higher. So, if more people are built, the profit will be less. It will be more profitable. What should we do to see the forest in the Freedom App? I have to download the Freedom App. I have to open the code, VISHU, which is my code. So, I will leave now. Okay, sir. Thank you for sharing so many things. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and questions in the studio. Thank you. Thank you. If you download the Freedom App and get the free course, the farmers will be happy and they will be able to work with it. So, thank you. Viswakumar, you can also download the Freedom App. You can get more information. You have two benefits. One, you can complete the course. And their referral code is also on the screen. If you see that and download it, you will get a scholarship of Rs. 3000. You can get two types of benefits. Now, a small break.

As a result, the forestry industry has begun to grow in the area of Jogimatti forest in Chitradurga, Kottayam. Therefore, the forestry authorities should pay attention to this. The purpose of the forestry authorities is to stop the offence and protect the forest.

 Hello everyone, welcome to Minute Story. In this video, I will tell you why these red sandalwoods are so costly and why the belts are illegal in India, which the government doesn't know. In red sandalwoods, high quality and high grade sandalwoods are available in India's Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kadapa, Chittoor and other parts of the world. These red sandalwoods are very expensive in China, Japan, Myanmar and other countries. In their country, the price of these red sandalwoods is very high. In every house in those countries, if you keep an item made of red sandalwoods in your house, a good tradition will follow from that time. In countries, the items made of red sandalwoods are very expensive and very expensive. The high quality red sandalwoods are very expensive in India. The smugglers in India are selling these red sandalwoods for 2 to 3 crores per ton. If you buy a red sandalwood from the forest department, you can buy belts from anywhere.

 Now, every day, we are bringing to you the stories of the four parts of the state, the farmer Yashogathe and their experiences. But today, we are introducing you to various farmers. Yes, from a young age, they grow and grow and grow new crops. They are inspired by these farmers. Gandhada Bedu, Sri Gandhada Nadu, is a famous state in Karnataka. We must be proud of this. First, the farmers of Sri Gandhada did not grow their crops on their own land. But, there is no problem. The government is also encouraging this growing. So, the farmer's farming has started in different parts of the state since the last few years. Many farmers have grown their crops since the last few days. In the small village of Bailusime, Gopalakrishna, Kolar district, Sri Gandhada, a small farmer has grown his crop in 12 acres. Here, you are seeing the half-settled village of Kolar, the garden of Gopalakrishna. The fields of Sri Gandhada here are about 6 years old. There are no more than 2000 trees here. The farmers are trying to get water from the water source. Sri Gandhada Faravalambi Gita. The farmer Gopalakrishna says that the crop has been grown in the garden. In the half-settled village, in survey no. 59, I have grown 12 acres of Sri Gandhada. When I grow Sri Gandhada, I want to plant Faravalambi with it. The water source is not sufficient for this garden. So, we have planted it with this garden. It needs water for 2 years. We have planted it with drip. The reason for the pruning is that the Gita has developed. We have not done pruning from the lower part of the Gita. We have taken only 3 feet of the Gita from the lower part. We have taken the soil from the lower part of the Gita. We have left everything there. It has been 6 years since we have planted it. It is not growing well until it is fully grown. It is growing slowly. The reason is that the soil is not growing well. The department says that the soil will start growing after 10-12 years. As per me, it will take 20 years. Today, people want to plant the soil. They are preparing for the soil to be planted in the farm. Now, more than 500 people have planted the soil. We are planting the seeds in the middle. The seeds are the flour, tomatoes, beans, papaya. We have done all kinds of pruning and we have been doing it for 6 years. We have taken the soil from the soil and we are doing it. Sri Gandha is a very strong tree. It is a big fear for the farmers who are trying to plant the soil. The trees that have been planted for 20 years, if they are not fed, they become very expensive and can be used for destruction. It takes time and effort. So, the government should make a good arrangement for the protection of Sri Gandha trees. This is the opinion of Gopalakrishna. Today, if it is smelly, all the farmers will be scared. If it is smelly, they will plant it in the DC office, in the government buildings, in the forest. They will be scared of how you will improve. We have planted it. We have asked the government to give subsidies to the Pensing. If we give subsidies, after 8-9 years, we should save the trees from dogs and dogs. This is a soap factory in Maratha. In Mysore soap factory, there is a factory in Bengaluru. They will make an agreement there. If we have the same rate, they will give it to us and they will make an agreement that we will purchase it. But I have not made any other agreement. The profit of this smelly crop is for the farmers. Today, if tomatoes are grown, the rates will not be high. So, the farmers will suffer a lot. Because, as you can see, the rate we get today, the same rate is given to every farmer twice. So, the rate is reduced and the farmers are in a situation to commit suicide by using the same rate. For that, in our village, in the 8 acres of land, we get the smelly crop, flour, papaya and salt. The profit is there. After the land is made of the smelly crops, the farmers have to take care of their health. The farmers pick up all the seeds from the ground and bring them to the ground. This is a good time to harvest the seeds. The farmers pick up the small seeds and feed them to the seeds and the flies. The farmers have no permission to harvest the smelly crop. The law has been broken. The farmers can harvest the smelly crop easily without any tension. For this, the farmers and the farmers are also getting full support. First, we saw the smelly crop in the forest. But, in 2001, the government gave the smelly crop to the farmers. The law allows the farmers to harvest the crop. In this state, in about 1000 acres of land, the crop is being harvested. In the forest and the forest area, the farmers are getting full support from the farmers. In the first year, the farmers get 40,000 hectares of support. When the farmers harvest the smelly crop, the government has to send the nurses or the foresters to the forest to harvest the crop. We are promoting this program called National Ayesh Mission from the Horticulture Department. The smelly crop is legalized. The farmers can harvest the crop in their own land. There are no other opportunities. So, now, the government has legalized this. The forest department and the foresters are providing the farmers with support to harvest the crop. We are promoting this program. The farmers are getting the crop. In the last three years, we have got 40 hectares of the smelly crop. The crop is not harvested by the monocrop, but by the intercrop. The farmers are getting the crop. In the first year, we give 40,000 hectares of the smelly crop to the farmers. In the second year, we give 10,000 hectares. In the first two years, we give 50,000 hectares of the crop to the farmers. They can get the crop in their own land. They don't have to do anything else. The seedlings of the smelly crop are available in the forest department. In our land, we get only the smelly crop. So, the farmers have to get the crop from the recognized farms. They have to get the crop from the forest department. Before getting the crop, they have to register in our department. We have a website called Fruits and Haseeru. They have to register in that website. We also issue them a work order. After that, they can get the seedlings from the NHP accredited or forest department and get the crop from their department. The next process is to apply the seedlings. We submit the seedlings to the farmers and we use the RTA to deposit the seedlings to their account. It's very simple. As simple as in our other departments or schemes, it is very simple to grow and get benefits from the department. In the majority of Kolaraj, farmers can see how the crop is growing in tomato, flour, potato, and other types. Along with that, there is a lot of other things. But instead, the farmers have these kinds of seeds, blood, smell, and the price of the seedlings is much higher. For the last 8-10 years, the farmers have been showing the desire of the farmers in the Sri Gandha agriculture. The farmers get 100 rupees in aid for the construction of the farms for three years. The government's budget or the government's budget for the companies that are in need of a farm is the right of the area. The area has become a part of the rural community. We have raised more than 10 lakhs of our crop to the Sri Gandha farmers. The farmers are very happy. The current rate of the crop is 2000 rupees per kg. The farmers can grow more and more. It is a world of caution. We can plant a lot of seeds in the land. If we plant it in a proper way, it will be very good. We can plant it in a proper way. The farmers are planting seeds in the middle of the farm. Some are planting it with the seeds. Some are planting it in the middle of the fields like papaya, horticulture species. They are planting it in the middle. If we plant it with other plants, it will be good. The farmers are planting it with soap and detergent or with handicrafts. We can plant it in a proper way. It is a bit difficult to plant it directly. There is no market. If we want to plant it, we can give it to the Sri Gandha farmers according to the standard rates. The Chippalwadi School is a good place to plant it. It is a good place to plant it. It is a good place to plant it. It is a good place to plant it. The Sri Gandha farmers are getting new food. The government is trying to encourage the farmers to plant it. But to protect the farmers from the trees that are standing, the Chippalwadi school is also being researched. The Sri Gandha farmers are getting the knowledge as soon as possible. Raghuraj, News 18 Kannada, Kuala Lumpur. Plantation is not an issue. The government is also trying to encourage the farmers to plant it. There is no problem with the construction. There is no problem with the construction.

The current rate of the company is 4 tons more than the previous one. The average expenditure is 45 to 40 thousand rupees. This is our work. We have been doing this for 3 years. The cutting has been started from the 7th year. The recommended time is 3 years after the harvest. But we have started the harvest after the 7th year. We have started the harvest after the 3rd year. The reason is that we have not installed the new plant. The harvest has started after 3 years. We can continue to harvest for 30 to 35 years. The cost of the plant is less.

 Here are traps. If it falls down, it will go inside. It will be multiple-factor. Immediately, my car will be moved to a location. If it needs to be cut, there will be a question of how thick it should be. It is totally black. You see this, right? This is a good symptom. It is like a diamond. We don't need permission for this white. We need to cut it. Immediately after submission, they give us 20%. It takes a month for it to dry. They pay the remaining amount. For 7 years. For 2 years? You have been working for 2 years? Yes, for 7 years. I was working in Srikandha. How many acres did you plant? 7 acres. 2 acres? How many acres? 800 acres. 2 acres for 800 acres? Yes, sir. I have planted 4 acres. How many acres? I planted one acre in the year 1990. I saw it in the year 1990. 800 acres means 8 crores. Sir, that's what it is. I don't know anything about it. Sir, it is like the word AS. That's what I meant. You are going in a positive direction, not a negative direction. It is a negative direction. There is no entry here. No entry. No entry. This is a fully protected area. There is no entry here. There is no entry here. This is a totally restricted area. No one has built a house here. There is live fencing and no bombs. This is 30 acres. That much is Srikandha? Yes, all of this is Srikandha. 30 acres is Srikandha? Yes, all of this is Srikandha. All of this is Srikandha. You can see everything here. All of this is Srikandha. This is a small quarter. This is a small quarter. You don't need any medicine here. The bones of the bones are in the small quarters. What is this? This is a medicine box. It is full of bad smell. This is a place for the birds to graze. Yes, this is a place for birds to graze. You have so many cuttings. This is a small quarter. This is a small quarter. This is a small quarter. This is a small quarter. There is no cultivation here. When did you build this? Every house has a complete history. Every house? Yes, every house. How many houses are there in 30 acres? There are 9000 houses. 9000 houses? Yes. 9000 houses is 1 lakh Srikandha? It is different from what I have seen. It is 90 crores. 90 crores? You will know if you also experience this. The price of this is different. The money, the crores, the satisfaction is here. 90 crores? We don't need that much to live. We can live in peace in some money. We don't need that much to live. What happens is, Look at this. Look at the birds. They eat a lot. They have put the seeds. They have emptied the plates. This is my dream to build a forest in Bishil. I want to build a forest in the coming four months. I want to take the form of a forest. There should be life, education and a lot of things. Here, we see the smell of the grass. These are all benign. Benign? These are all benign. These are all benign. Here, that is benign. That is benign. If you look here, there are about 500 benign trees. 30 trees means that there are about 1000 benign trees. Oh, you have planted 3000 trees. Yes, there are about 500-30 trees. You feel something when you walk here, right? You feel something when you walk on the grass. In that soil, the organic carbon is created here. It is going up and down. This is benign. What happens is that the trees grow on the ground. The trees grow on the ground. The trees grow on the ground. The birds that come up on the ground are the birds. The trees grow on the ground. Not on the ground, but on the ground. This is benign. This is benign. This is our national tree. This is a forest-like height. Here, natural regeneration is happening. Here, all this. We have seen that plot, right? The beauty of natural regeneration is that this is actually forest farming. Here. The plants, the plants, the trees. This is the whole world. If you see this, you can make a huge Ph.D. in this. You can see the plants. This is how much it is. It is a huge Ph.D. Like this. So, a plant is created for a number. One plant, one tree, one tree. All of this is created for a number. The plants, the soil, the plants. The plants, the plants, the plants. All of this is created for a number. These are all the plants. You planted these, but you didn't plant the plants. These are all the plants. I planted these here. I planted these here. You planted the number. I planted these here. Why did you plant the number? I did it myself. Did you plant the number? No. This is a trick that I learned from my father. I can't disclose it now. I will do it after another 2-3 years. This is a way to protect yourself. For a numbering. There are traps inside this. If you just lift 10 kg, we will go inside at least 10 feet. You can't go anywhere with this plant. No one will come here. Here or there. There are traps. I will come after seeing that track. Someone came here safely. There is no one to go safely. It is a farm. So you can't run here? No, you can't run here. No one has an entrance here. Before the gardener comes to work, there are 2 of us. If we lift 10 kg, we will be looking here. Here are the traps. If we lift 10 kg, we will be able to get the location. I have a mobile. We can get the location immediately. It will blink. It will give a notification. This is completely protected. No safety measures are required. In India, we have taken everything here. This is not a place where you can just come and go. Here it is like that. There are people who came after lifting 10 kg. Listen. It is a multiple-factor. Can we see the trap? No, no trap. No need. This type. What happens after that? What happens to us is, if we want to build a Srikandha, we have to be very strong. Some people ask this. If we want to build a Srikandha, can we build it so strong? They ask. When this sandalwood is used, there is no linear relationship between the size of the plant and the volume of the plant or the biomass of the plant. There is no linear relationship between the size of the plant the volume of the plant or the biomass of the plant. If the sandalwood is used so strong, the whole hole can rotate, around 60 cm. This is not an autolysis. So there is no linear relationship. If this much sandalwood is used, If it was this much, there would be nothing inside it. There is a bark inside this, a small sharp wood, full of art wood. There is no linear relationship. Sandalwood should not be too thick. It is a secondary metabolism. It is nothing but, as we have said, secondary metabolism is nothing but, it is one of the defensive mechanism against rot. It is nothing but formation of art wood and accumulation of oil. Look at the stress level of the plant. It is totally black. This is a good symptom. It is like a diamond. It is like a diamond. How old is this tree? This is already 4 years old. It is about 5 years old. The plant is under a lot of stress. That is very important. We give water and coconut to it. It grows vegetatively. But it does not go under stress. It does not suffer. It comes when it is needed. When it is under stress, it is formed quickly. This is sandalwood. It is not a market. How do you know? Then there is the protection. We can discuss it later. Protection is one of the challenges. What have we taken for this? We have taken maximum. Now that you have come, we will not tell your Aadhar number. Then we will put the dog seat. CC camera traps. Then, what is the market? Before 2001-2002, there was no opportunity to build it. In 2001-2002, the law was passed. Where the Srikand was, it was the property of the white people. This is an opportunity. The law has made it an opportunity. One minute. Manoj, Where is the area palm? Is it your section? No, it is not there. Now, what happens? The final is marked. Where should the mark be made? Now, what is the existing law? It should be given to KSDL. Mysore Sandal Soap. KSDL. We need competitive value as a society. We have been in Bandu for 16 years. We have experienced a lot of things. We are saving ourselves by working hard. Now, thousands of people are coming to me. If we want competitive value, we need options. What happens here is, we have to give one to KSDL. Monopoly. Yes, this is in Monopoly. Number of... Number of... Buyers. We call it Monopoly. Correct. Buyers per acre. One seller. That is Ambani. That is what it is. There is no alternative choice. One seller. Everyone should be able to get what they pay. Monopoly is the only option. There are no other options to purchase. One seller. Monopoly is the only option. For any country's economy, for any country's healthy economy, Monopoly is the way. There is exploitation. There is no scientific research. There is no scientific rate. There is exploitation. I have to take whatever he gives. That is why we call it Monopoly. When you come to Sandalwood, there is an opposite here. What happens here is, the number of sellers is one buyer. What was there? The number of buyers is one seller. The number of sellers is one buyer. That is KSDL. That is a politics. There is no alternative choice. What is this? We call it Monopsony. This is Monopsony. Here is the exploitation. He is not giving to anyone. He should be given. He gives the same rate. We are not getting any more loans. There is no alternative choice. Here is Monopsony. That means the farmers are being exploited. There are no more loans. Because this is the time of arraign. The farmers are coming to the market. We have to ask them. We have to give them. Because the government should not support the exploitation. If someone is exploited, we have to support them. That is why the government is listening to our words. We are in constant contact with ministers and other people. We are holding an association with our farmers. But from the beginning, to sell our land, there are many players who are selling our land. We can sell our land to them. But now there is no such law. It will change in the next 2-3 years. It will be sold to private people. Yes sir. When it comes to us, we are the first farmers who are working. We have to buy and process our land. We have to buy and process our land. I am the son of a 100 acres. There is a Ramesh Balutti family of 5000 acres. 5000 acres. Today, the development of the country is 5,000 crores. If we want to buy a lot of raw material, we don't have to go anywhere. If we come to Ramesh Balutti, in the coming days, we will get worth 15,000 crores of raw material. Even if we have that much, we don't know what kind of disaster it will be or the situation of the farmers. My first soap will start from here. Soap, cosmetics, perfumes, incense, and other by-products will start. But what I have is even if my 100 acres of srikanth is sold, I will start from the beginning. I can't start from the beginning and start a new one. But many people say, making India. In the Indra region, starting from the beginning, creating a new one, creating a new job. But when it comes to the srikanth, I don't have the opportunity to start from the beginning. I have already registered as Gandha Medicinal and Aromatic Company. But in a few days, it will start. I am the first one. So, what I have now is to purchase oils, from others, I have to purchase oil and do soap and cosmetics. But we are ready for that. But one request to the government is that today, the market should liberalize us a little bit. Who will give us the medical bill, to make it right for them, I have a request to make it possible. That too, the suggestion and discussion has been made by the government. In the coming days, we can make it possible. But the existing law is that we have to give it to KSDL. RNI and KSDL. How can it be done? I mean, I am already in the country. Do I need permission to leave? No, you don't need permission to leave. You have to build it. What we have to do is to give it to KSDL and to RNI. Then, what they do in KSDL is they also take our documents and give it to RNI to purchase it. They also do this. We have to do an MOU in KSDL. Memorandum of Understanding. After that, they come to RNI and take these documents and give it to them. We have to build it and give it to KSDL. They dress it up and do grading on it. They do grading, dry it and fix the rate. After going to the factory, the rate is fixed? Yes, it is fixed. In the coming days, we are very optimistic. From now on, the government will give the MOU and the market to the people. How will the payment be? For example, KSDL will take it. After taking KSDL, they will give the payment first 20% immediately after submission. After going to the lorry. They will give us 20% of the payment. After that, it takes one day to dry. After one day, they will pay the remaining amount. This is the type. So, 20% advance is given. After it dries, they will settle. So, the quality is known. Yes. There are many advantages in the market. Even others will purchase immediately and give the payment on the world. They will give it here. Give it to the private owners. This is our request. Because, I have been working for 16 years as a farmer, and I have given shelter to animals. Even if they are not financially successful, the government should support them. But, KSJ will give the payment? Yes, they will. They will give the payment. Thank you for watching.

 Now what has happened is, if someone is lying down, if he has a tractor, he will call someone and pull out the seeds here. There is no seed left. He will pull out the tractor. He will spray a chemical. He doesn't know what those chemicals are. Why is he scared? He is scared because of heat. It's not heat. The medicine that you sprayed on your forehead has come. That is what causes cancer. A man who wants to come to agriculture, or wants to do some work, he will work in a food shop. So can he come here? No, he can come. When he comes, if he earns 2 lakhs per month, he shouldn't come here, asking for 3 or 4 lakhs. Definitely he must have 10 lakhs. He can earn 10 lakhs per month. But he should love it. He should not have money vemos, he should love it. He should love it. He should love it. He should love it. He should make it. He should put money aside in monetary terms. Then he comes. It takes his own time. That's the way. But it can be difficult to earn money. But it can't be done fast. Now, after finishing some work, immediately you go for a campus interview, andgens offer letter, job, that is not possible. You should do weekend raja. No? No. What is the secret? 24 hours? No, no. You can be a week raja, or a full day monk. Now I am like that. What do you think? I am the boss, who is that? No. I will take my time. I should talk to you, I should cook with you, I should do arti with you, I should go out with you, I should talk about this. Who is there for me? I am a full day monk. No problem. So you don't need weekend? No. For this holiday? No. Four kids have finished their exams. I am the one who is not in a schedule. I don't need to tell anyone. My work, I will be in a full holiday for a month. This is a very, very holistic job. This is a very peaceful way of life. There is no one here. No targets. No firewood. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. But if there is no one, agriculture is a loss. Work is a loss. That is what I am talking about. We have discussed a lot. We need a plan. We need a long term plan, a short term plan. I have told you, what will happen is, I will immediately take a pen and put it in a bundle, and I will do it day and night. Step by step. I will put in a little effort in the initial days. But today I am calm. There is a system. You have seen it yourself. Young regeneration. I have not done anything at this time. So you have not done anything at 90% of what you have done? Yes, by this time it is already 50%. More than 50%. Then natural regeneration is done. Then, what I have done, it is getting better. What happens here is, once it starts, it is like singing De Nevala Jebi De Tha De Tha Chappad Paadi. It is not like that. It is not like that. But it takes time. What I am doing now is, I have started the Oda. This year, I will not speak. This is about 20 years of effort. I have 20 years of experience. Today, my 20 years of experience is new. It is special. Yes. It is heard at any time. It is heard at any time. It is heard at any time, at any time. It is heard at any time. It is heard. It does not take 20 years to finish. It needs. I am not sure what happened immediately, what miracle did we do, what magic did we do, how I have saved the Earth, how I have made the Earth a fruit, how I am going to reach the goal of these goals, how I can achieve the goals, all these have been the result of about 20 years of effort. Not like what I have done now, it has been completed. I have not come to succeed. There is still work to be done. I know what to do. I know how much to do. I know how much to improve. Is there more work to be done? There is 90% more work to be done. There is so much work to be done. This is an ocean. We have to do the work of agriculture. Agriculture is a very interesting field. It is very interesting. I will say something. In this world, any job, any profession, any political life, any health, any education, any spiritual life, is given only by agriculture. Agriculture alone. There is health, education and both. There is a life of education, a life of health and a life of education. I am going to BOSHA here. I have a lot of unplanned trips. I will spend more time with my family. It is an opportunity. Family time. There is no plan. We went last time. We went to some ocean beaches. We went to the forest gardens. They were pending for 4 days. They never came. We went to our forest gardens. How are the forests in Mallinadi? How is their farming? Now we have come to see everything. It is a very special temple. We went. We used to sleep in that temple. When my children were born, I thought it was a big temple, but I didn't see anything special because it was in my heart. I told him, we are in Kunti, it is a small temple, a historical place, but I feel a spiritual state of peace and serenity in my heart. I told him, there is nothing special about this temple. This ruthi is a wonderful and happy thing. Those who have not seen it, should experience it. You cannot express it. The ruthi is a kind of agriculture. There is no other ruthi. The ruthi is a kind of happiness. What I feel is that we have built a temple in Bisilnadan. It is a place where you can see the beauty of the temple. Is it possible to build it in a small size? Ramesh has always been a rich man. But he was born small. No, he can do better. Small family, small family. That family is a big family. 100 acres of land. But even if there were 2-3 acres of land, he could do it. He could build a forest in 10 Kuntis. It is possible. In half an acre, in one acre, he could build a forest. A farming forest. He could build a family forest for his family. It is possible. He could build a school for other poor people. He could also build a big forest for the poor. It is possible. It is not possible for the poor. I have not built a big temple. I have not spent millions of rupees on building a palaeo. I have not done any Israel-like things. Nothing. It is a little bit like this. You should know do's and don'ts. What if you do this? What if you do this? What if you do this, what will be lost? What can you gain if you do this? It is a little bit like this. What our farmers are doing is, they are doing what they can and are giving up. They are giving up with a little bit of trouble. What about traditional methods? Traditional method is ultimate. But we have already come a long way beyond traditional. We have already come a long way beyond traditional. Today our life is like this. Today we don't need any coal. Coal should not smell. We don't need any wood or any wood. We should be like this. Our song is like this. When we get the coconut, we strike. Our grandfather, our great grandfather, like a Sampradaya, he used to plant the best seeds in the year before. This year he was doing a strike. He planted the seeds in the morning? Yes. He planted the seeds that were needed this year. All the seeds, Dweedala, Akadi Kal, our Jola, Sajje, all our oil seeds, even all the Pundi seeds, were all taken care of. What is happening now is, if there are four seeds that are to be sold next year, the coconut will be taken away today. When the coconut is sold today, he will call someone and tell them to get the tractor. He will call someone and tell them to get the tractor. He will call someone and tell them to get the tractor. He doesn't have a plan. If he doesn't have a plan, he doesn't take it seriously. He is sad. He doesn't have enthusiasm. That is the situation. Already, in the earth, we are taking money today. As a mechanical engineer, the temperature in the earth is decreasing. When the temperature in the earth is decreasing, the moisture holding capacity is decreasing. The power to stop the evaporation is decreasing. At the same time, the power to stop the flow of water is decreasing. Now, we are living in a time where we eat biscuits and bread. This is the age. Processed foods. Chips, lez, this is the symbol of our culture. We have become modernized. Life is not like this. It is like this. Today, the farmers, in the 60s, the agriculture after the 10s, is called the agriculture without noise. It is not the agriculture of the farmers. It is the agriculture without noise. Today, the farmers, if I may say, I will take a picture. The agriculture today, the farmers spray chemicals. They don't know what those chemicals are. They don't know what the government, the farmers, and our system is. They don't know what insecticide is used. What contact insecticide, systemic insecticide, and what fungi side is used. They don't know what contact fungi side is, systemic fungi side, broad spectrum fungi side. They don't know. We are going to a place of meditation. What happens is, if one plant is grown, in 100 acres, one of the 9 acres is wasted. That's how it is. But this is already a waste. It has gone to that extent. Then it should be developed. Otherwise, from the front, the farmers will get even more serious. Because now it is already very serious. The number of farmers, the number of farmers, the number of farmers, the number of farmers, the number of farmers, the power to build a city, is not in the hands of the farmers. We are all suffering from this. So, we should not underestimate the farmers. At least, we should not underestimate them. We should think seriously about the benefits and problems of the farmers. That is the reason they were born. But, the farmers, the NPK fertilizers, the micronutrients, the stimulants, the insecticides, the pesticides, the stimulants, all of this is long-term and short-term. These are the benefits and the problems. The power to completely decompose is not given by the government but by the government. We should make an arrangement to get the jobs done. It is not enough to do it in the soul. It is happening. What is happening today? I do not know if it is MRL. What is MRL? What is happening today? One sprays Proclame, one sprays Carbon Degenerate, one sprays Methomyl, and one sprays it today. It is harvested in the evening and then brought to the market the next day. Methomyl. It is 90 days MRL. Is that the content of the chemical? Yes. We call it the maximum residue limit. It is not eaten for 90 days. But, it is being sold the next day. We, our children, our family eat it. We think it is fresh, shiny, and good. We eat it as a good fruit. We eat it for 2-3 days and then we start talking about the stomach. Why do we talk about the stomach? It is not the stomach. The chemical that you sprayed on the Methomyl is the same. It is cancer. It is cancer. It is happening. You do not know him. He has been harvesting for 90 days. Who is he? You do not know him? Sir, when he sprays, he says that the chemical should be removed. He needs it. He wants it to be strong. He is like that. He comes to my place when he is done immediately. He is like that. He is like that. He is like that. Who knows? Where is the person who knows the answer? He is like that. He has been fighting for so long. He has been fighting. He is dead. He has not been arrested. He is like that. We are all concerned about his farming. We will take it all. We will take it all. Whether it is good or bad. We will give it to you. We do it at home. We take small pieces of grass We are all living in the same place. It is not possible to do that. It is the power of God. Who are these people? Are they in any other educational programs? No, they are not. They are the ones who need it. This is the Mool. This is the Mool. Thank you for watching this interview. Thank you for watching.

 I'm coming to Tavare Thotta from Chandanamana. I'd like to thank our old police officer Sundar for his hard work and his son for saving the sand. I'd like to thank him for building the fort. I'd like to thank our old police officer Sundar for his hard work and his son for saving the sand. He was a member of the Kempammana court case. Chandasekar was my classmate. His son, Abha Vishwa, is the person who acted in that case. We all trust him. Sundar is the only son. He's a software engineer. He's a young boy. Udda, he's a boy named Udda. He's a 6 feet tall boy. He's a 6 feet tall Udda. He's a very amazing artist. He's played in the Kempammana court case. He directed a short film. It was a great short film. It was a great short film. What was the name of the film? It was called Reckoning. Reckoning. I didn't understand English. I was in 8th grade. It was a great film. Now, Sanjay Shantaram, the father of our Swami Ayyappa film, Ayyappa Swami, was in the film. He was the leading actor in the film, in the film, Manne Kempe Gowda. He had a wonderful performance. I went to his memorial and I advised him for the first time. It's very easy for those who know dance and recording. But if you enter a battlefield and meet the battlefield, it will be very nice. You will be able to accept the acting more. I advised him to learn different techniques. Now, my other disciple, my younger one, Vivekanth Bagalkoti, he's a software engineer. He's directing a film called Kushmanda Roopa. In that film, he's one of the heroes. He can be a second hero or anti-hero. What do you think about Kushmanda Roopa? You've worked for two days, right? When I saw Kushmanda Roopa, I told him a lot of stories. I didn't tell him the whole story. Because he didn't like to leave the story. How old are you with your father? Chandanavanna's farm. You were taking water from the bottom. I saw it in my eyes. You and your father made cement blocks to protect the animals. We built a fort like structure for each other. Veera shot it. It's amazing. How did you come up with this idea? What do you want to do? Are you interested in farming? After the kids play, the kids will be like this. What do you want to do after the farm? To tell the history of the farm, it's been 10-12 years. You said 14 years. We built a fort. We built a fort and watered it for 12 years. There were no facilities for water. My father used to cut the grass and water it. We used to put it in the garden. Now it's all checked down. We have two motors. Water comes easily. There's no problem with that. Water comes and it's all lighted up. Now there are more problems with the stones. We knew that the stones were placed in corners. Someone had cut a layer in the corner. We knew that. They were checking how much sand we could get. Since then, I and my father thought about it. We thought of putting sensors in it. But there was no sensor supply. We thought of doing something else. So, my father and I came up with an idea. We'll build 8K blocks. We thought it would be cheaper than building. We built 50 to 60 blocks in a week. We've built 150 blocks. We've made cement, concrete and so on. We've built a fort. We've built it strong. But you've built a fort. Only rainwater will go. You're carrying sand. There's nothing. We need to give space for more water. We've left one foot apart. There should be space for water and rain. Apart from farming, apart from farming, you should move forward in cinema or should you continue in software? Or should you continue in the form of a farmer? What's your goal? What do you want? What do you think? If I say software, we don't outsource. We've made a product called TV Connect. You've set up a studio and you've done a lot. You've set up a studio there. You've acted, dubbed. You've done it on the ground. You've done it on the ground. When you were a kid, you had to find out. What should I do at this age? What should I do at this age? I'm also at that age. You're at that age. I'm not your age to come to a film. I'm 15 years old. You've all been born with a golden spoon in your mouth. You've been born with a golden spoon in your mouth. You've been born with a golden spoon in your mouth. You've been born with a golden spoon in your mouth. You didn't come last time, right? You didn't come last time, right? How are you feeling now? What I'm feeling is, you've said software engineers or people who go to work, they have a 9 to 5 job. Saturday, Sunday, they should come. Everyone should come. If it's 50 to 60 kilometers, it's difficult. It can be 20 kilometers. 25 kilometers from the centre of the city. They should come on Saturday, Sunday, relax and go. They've made a good place and a good atmosphere. What do you think of the games? The games are here. He doesn't touch the eye candy. He touched the eye candy first. I was very happy. They've done everything well. Then the environment came. So, all the best for your future. Our boy Vishveshwara, come out nicely. Already, you're a 2 inch coconut tree. I can see how cool you are. I can see your growth. Look at this boy. He's a wonderful artist. He's got a good talent, a good voice, a good base voice. He's got a good heart for everything. You tell your friends about our tower. Definitely. So, today, we'll end this episode. What do you say? Chandana Manada, Sundararaju, Sundararajara, our son Vishveshwara, our Kashi Vishveshwara. We'll trust his love. We'll trust his love.

 We are going to build a small Shrigandha garden in this area. If we do this, we can show the village of Timappa and Raju from Kurupurilligram, which is located in the same district of Iruvu Taluk. They have done a great job. They have given Shrigandha plants in a small garden. We have made a small garden and made a small garden. After the Shrigandha garden was built, we took the seeds from the Shrigandha tree and planted them in the trees. They have planted lakhs of seeds in the area. They have built the Shrigandha garden in their village. They are the members of Jaggi Vasudeva Baba and Kaveri Kugu. I will show you the Shrigandha garden. My name is Veerajobin Venkatappa from Kurupurilligram, Ikkanur post, Iruvu Taluk, Chitruga district. We have planted the Shrigandha plants in our land because of Jaggi Vasudeva Baba's prayer. This is the Chitruga district, the whole of Iruvu Taluk and the entire Shrigandha region is in the same district. The Gurus have given us their prayers. We have planted nine districts in this area. We have planted the seeds in the same area. We have done all this because of their prayers. The water that is coming to the farmers is the water from the ground. The farmers use the water from the ground to make the water. This is very beneficial for the water. It is a good suggestion for the farmers to make the water. We have been getting good water from the ground since the last few years. I would like to encourage all the farmers to use this water. This is a good idea. It will also increase the water content. The water content will increase and the farmers will be more productive. The farmers can use this water to stop the water content. I would like to encourage the farmers to use this water.

 Namaskar! Welcome to Atmeyar Raitar with Sanchi TV News. Today we have come to Kottalagi village. We have come to the village of Srikandada Gidakala Mahitya. Till today, the situation has been like this. There were two Srikandada Gidakala on the hill. We don't know when they will take them away from the stone. But in the Taluka of Belagav district, in Kottalagi village, one farmer left all the traditional fields and started a Srikandada farm. That too in Hattuekara. Come and get to know that farmer. And also come and get to know all the Srikandada Gidakala Mahitya. Come and get to know the farmer first. My name is Sidra Irapa, from L.D. I am from Belagavanjala, in the Taluka of Atmeyar Raitar, Kottalagi. I used to do farming. My ancestors used to do farming. Later I started farming. How did you get the idea to start a Srikandada Gidakala farm? Now, if we want to start a Srikandada farm, it will be done on its own. Because, when we do it on our own, we are doing it by ourselves. The labor rate has increased. The rate of cow dung has increased. The rate of medicine has increased. Now, in terms of investment, in the absence of work, the situation has become like this. Now, Menaka Nagamma's family, if they have their own family, they can work and earn their living. Now, we have to work like this. If we have to water the fields, we have to work from the side. We have to work from the side. If we work from the side, we can earn our living. If we work from the side, we can earn our living. How many acres of Srikandada Gidakala have you planted? How many trees have you planted in one acre? How many trees have you planted in the middle? I planted Srikandada Gidakala in 10 acres of land. In total, I planted 80 acres of land. In 80 acres, I have planted 10-15% of the land. Now, in one acre, I have planted 325 trees. How much is the difference? There are 16 trees on one side and 8 trees on the other side. Now, I have planted 300 trees. In total, I have planted 300 trees in 3 acres. In total, I have planted 300 trees in 3 acres. I have been planting trees for the past 3 years. Now, it is 3 years. If we plant trees in the front, it will take another 2-3 years. We have been planting trees for 1 year. We have been seeing many such trees. We cannot use any other example. We have planted trees in the same color as the trees. At the same time, the trees are growing. In the same forest, we have planted trees in the 3-4 years. We have been thinking about this since long. We have taken the responsibility to protect this forest. We have taken the responsibility to protect this forest. This is our task. How many kinds of species are there in Srikandada forest? And what kind of species of forests do you plant? How do you manage the land? When we are in Srikanth, we have different castes. We have one caste. In any other country, we have only one. In Srikanth, we have a small village. We have a small village. We have different castes. We have a big village. We have different castes. We have two castes. But when we go abroad, we have to go to Canada. We have to make a difference there. If we have different castes, we can get a 20% increase in the rate. We can get a higher rate. We can get a higher rate on the land and on the climate. What are the medicines you use to make the land more fertile? In Srikanth, we have soft soil. We make the soil soft and make the soil dry. Then we can make the soil dry. We have to see the soil. We have to plant the seeds in the ground. We have to make the soil dry. We have to plant the seeds in the ground. We have to plant the seeds in the ground. We have to plant the seeds in the ground. We plant the seeds in the ground in the old land. Then we can plant the seeds there. We plant the seeds in the old land. We plant the seeds there. What is the status of the water? For Srikanth, we require water for compulsory 7 years. 7 years. We have to water up to 7 days. We have to water up to 7 days, for the drip. we applied the artists passed Nothing is for our needs. You want for power economic just that one. We went in search of good ones.

Such 밀k years of Srich basis of parts is 8.9 salary. 16 years ago we could have got 1 lakh rupees from one place. We could have got 1 lakh easily. Before, 16 years ago we didn't have any money. For one year we had 10% more money. For 28 years we didn't have any money. For 20 years we had only 1 lakh rupees. For 16 years we had 1 lakh rupees. For 5 years we had only 1 lakh rupees. This is the reason why we have been able to get it. We can get it if we need it. Otherwise we wouldn't have got this much money. If we didn't get the rate, we would have got 1 lakh rupees. This is the reason why we have been able to get it. Who allowed you to build the Shrikhanda Gidai? The reason why we don't need any permission is because our farmers don't know about this. The government allowed us to build it when we were around 70 years old. We were only 70 years old. But we need our permission to build it. We have been here for 8 years. But we don't have the permission to build it. This is the reason why we're creating a space for all the farmers to build their own Gidai. We can't allow them to build more. That's why we are here. and this is the new one and you have not picked any other tree in Srikandha Gita? this is the Srikandha Savolambi tree this is Paravolambi tree this is the Chogisitri tree this tree is called Chogisitri tree where it was planted?

 Friends, you can subscribe to our channel and click the bell button to get notified about our new videos. Welcome to the Vishmaya Kannada channel. Friends, India may have been a golden age in the ancient times, but you may not know it. Because the natural resources of India were the natural resources of the Heralas. If you destroy the most ancient structures in India, you may become a magician in some time. But India has a very rich history. They have this blood moon. Friends, you may have seen the painting of Pushpa the rice, which you saw in the beginning. But the story revolves around this blood moon. In science, this non-formal tree called Tera corpus centillinus is found only in South India. In it, the most rich and high quality blood moon trees are found only in the end of Andhra Pradesh. More than the tree of Srivastri in South India, this blood moon tree is more popular. As I said earlier, in the end world, this non-formal and high quality tree is found only in our India. If you ask for the value of this blood moon, you will definitely be surprised. Yes, this blood moon, which is made of stone, is 1 kg in size, and is worth 20 to 30 thousand rupees. A 10-ton blood moon tree can hold up to 20 to 30 kg of stone. If you smuggle it and change it, you will get up to 6 lakhs worth of stone. So, if you don't have a ton of blood moon, you will get 2 crores of rupees. For this reason, the special forces are also responsible for the safety of the tree. Friends, why is this blood moon so rare and rare? In ancient times, our ancestors used to make blood moon in Ayurveda. Later, it can be used to cure skin diseases. As time goes by, the best blood moon in India is known to the world. For this reason, it can be used in various traditional medicines and beautiful items. In fact, the value of very expensive items is very high. For example, take petrol. In any country, the oil prices are very low in that country. But in India, petrol is rare, but petrol and diesel are very popular. The same situation is also a blood moon. Blood moon is found only in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. From here, many trees are cut down by the foreign countries. But China does not use this blood moon. Because China uses this blood moon tree in the mines and other areas. So much so that China has come to cure thousands of diseases from diseases. Now, blood moon can be used in thousands of diseases. Because of this, the value of blood moon in China is very high. In China alone, blood moon can be used in Japan and Mongolia to cure diseases. So, if we take out the medicinal properties of blood moon, China will not like this blood moon. About 700 years ago, during the 14th century, the Ming dynasty ruled China. According to the report published in China Daily, the blood moon was made by the Ming dynasty's royal family. And such decorative items were very rare. At that time, the royal family said that blood moon was made from the places where it was possible. They decorated the palace with blood moon furniture and decorative items. We can see the characteristics of the Chinese museum that made blood moon. Even though the blood moon escaped to the mines and saved many lives, these laws were not implemented by the politicians, officials and police. The story of the blood moon is true. When the blood moon was in need of food in China, the death of trees began in the last forest. The workers went to the forest, cut down the trees and gave them to smugglers to earn money. Sometimes smugglers would cut down the trees and carry them in their pockets. These workers were ready to face any kind of danger. The police did not care. It is not wrong that the former king of China was a slave of the workers. The blood moon tree is about 8 to 11 meters long. Another feature of this tree is the time it takes to grow. If a tree is 10 years old, it takes 30 years to grow a blood moon tree. But if it is grown through farming, it will take at least 15 years to grow a tree. As mentioned earlier, the blood moon is in need of food in the international market. Because of this, the government spends millions of rupees every year on these trees for safety. The area of this forest is very important. Because smugglers do not smuggle blood moon when they are young. Smugglers usually supply 20,000 crores of blood moon to the government every year. If these trees are smuggled, they will be sentenced to 15 years in prison. It would be a challenge for the government to protect the blood moon. Then you may ask, is this a blood moon tree? There is no answer to this. There is a tree that is about the size of a blood moon. That is African Blackwood. Yes, you may be surprised to hear the price of this tree. The price of this tree is 8,000 pounds or 7 lakh rupees per kg in the international market. So African Blackwood is a very rare tree on earth. This tree is about 20 to 40 feet tall. This African Blackwood is found in 26 countries in Central and South Africa. This unformed tree, which is more grown in the land of the West, can be harvested for 60 years. But this tree is most common in Kenya and Tanzania, which is more likely to be smuggled. Therefore, this unformed tree is in the

 From this we can earn around 1,20,000 rupees In the private market, the price of this tree is around 10 to 15 thousand rupees This tree depends on the water and food needs of the tree If we look here, the tree is 5 feet tall and has a good height Greetings to all This is a very valuable tree It is famous in the world for its fragrance This tree is very popular in the national and international market But this tree is very popular in the market The reason is that the cultivation practice of this tree is very good We call this tree as a hemiroot parasite The structure of this tree is not developed properly This tree depends on another tree If you are growing in Srikanth, you need to find a host plant The reason for the formation of the tree is that it does not have the ability to take water, minerals and nutrients This tree depends on the water and nutrients of the tree If we look at the host plants of this tree First of all, agroforest trees Then there are aranya plant plants Then there is the tea tree Then there is the honey tree Then there is the tea tree Then the best host of this tree is the mulberry We can also host the honey trees The host plant you are selecting should not be more than the tree of Srikanth Because the heartwood is very important in Srikanth So to form the heartwood and oil, it needs to be very hot and sunny If we select a very hot tree, it will give us heat Then the heartwood formation will not be possible In that we call the tree of Srikanth as a stress-loving plant If the stress is more, the tree will grow well I told you earlier that if you want to form the heartwood, the tree needs to be hot and sunny So only if you get all these, the tree will grow well The distance is very important to plant the host plant After planting the host plant, you need to put the tree of Srikanth from 2.5 to 3 meters The best host plant for the Srikanth is the leguminous plant The leguminous plant helps to stabilize the environment And it helps to grow enough leguminous plants for the Srikanth There are two types of host plants One is the primary host and the other is the permanent host The primary host is the one that needs to be sown for 6 months to 2 years The next one is the permanent host After 2 years, we need to plant the permanent host The primary host is the one that needs to be sown The secondary host is the one that needs to be sown The primary host can be sown with tea, honey, honey trees or even glyricidia The use of glyricidia and sesbenia will help to grow more species These two plants are the main reason for the growth of these two plants The Srikanth plant is also very useful for the growth of these two plants The main reason for the growth of the Srikanth plant is The tree is a rain-capped tree You should not plant this tree in the water I have already mentioned that If you want to have a heart-wood and oil content formation in this tree You need to have enough light and moisture Otherwise, if you water it too much, it will not form a heart-wood And the quality of the oil content will also be very low If you want to plant the host plant in the Srikanth tree The water content should not be more than 5 feet It should also be rain-capped If you water the host plant too much, it will affect the Srikanth plant If you want the Srikanth plant to grow, the space is also very important Because it is a host plant, we need to give 5 feet space to the host and the Srikanth plant If you give more space than 5 feet, the host plant will not connect with the host plant It will be difficult to get water and moisture We will also show the same example in the same garden If we look here, the tree is growing well because of the 5 feet space If you look at the other tree in the same garden, the growth is not correct Because the host plant is too far away, it is not suitable for the tree to grow We call this tree the wider adaptability crop Because we can grow this tree in any environment If you give 10 feet space to one tree, you can plant 160 trees This tree can grow from 15 to 20 years So, from one tree we can get 20 kg of hardwood Now, in the market rate, we can get 6,000 rupees for one tree If we plant 20 kg of hardwood from one tree, we can get 1,200,000 rupees So, if we plant 160 trees per acre, we can get 2 crores of money from 160 trees In between the trees, we can plant papaya, lemon, cardamom, and cinnamon We can get money from them But if we want to grow this tree, the main problem is that it will be stung We can take this tree and go So, we have to give protection to this tree Because of the production of this tree, the government is supporting the tree The Government of Karnataka has also supported the project Grow More Sandalwood To protect this tree, we have to protect this tree by using microchips To protect this tree, the government has a protection system This is to protect trees by using microchips We can take 8 feet of wood from the ground and put it in the trees This is done by Indian Wood Science and Technology So, if a stone comes to your garden, there will be a drone, night vision camera, day vision camera When someone comes to your garden, they capture the images in the camera There is a server in the microchip, and the server is connected to Indian Wood Science and Technology If someone comes to your garden, they will also get a signal When you cut the tree and take it, you can even track the stone If you want to protect this protection system in your garden, you should put at least 100 trees But this is dependent on the government If you want to do it yourself, you can put a sharp stone around it If a stone is too sharp, it will not be cut easily If a stone is 40-50 feet long, it will not be seen even if the tree is cut by the government You can also use other methods to protect the trees You can use a barbed wire to protect the trees You can also use a barbed wire to protect the trees If you put dogs in your garden, they will also protect the dogs You can also install a CCTV camera Since this tree is expensive, the government has also provided the facilities If you want to buy a seedling, you can get it at a subsidy rate of 3-5 rupees You can also get insurance for the sale of the tree You can also get insurance for the sale of the tree You can also get insurance for the sale of the

 When you start planting in June, you don't know when another rain will come If you don't take this risk, you will get a good harvest If the plants are good, the water will be good, the water will be good If you plant a little bit of fungi on the pesticide, you will get a root shock If you plant a little bit of the root shock, you will get a root shock If you spray some little chilled termites or upsetanth enforcable,�들 might proceed to do some work If you get a little moreiert, your plant will get protected When you plant that plant, you are sure to do that when the primary growth wither Soap Then the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Swamy whouksai. So when you begin, you come in front of the primary host, and peculiarly, after the primary host comes in the second appeal you start the second communication. If you look at the three trees, all the trees are straight. None of the trees are connected to this tree. Have you observed? None of the trees are connected to this tree. Then the trees that come around this tree, the root connection comes from three trees. The tree starts in the morning. We are looking at the condition of that tree. If you are going to suppress that tree, you have to control that tree. You have to control the growth by cutting it. We can cut only one tree, sir. You can cut only one tree, sir. The advantages of cutting only one tree are less. That's why if you cut different trees, different trees, different nutrients will also go. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. The trees that are near the tree will also go automatically. This is one. The roots of the sand will not stay here. The roots will start spreading out. So, if you keep one tree 5 meters away from the other, there will be space in the tree. In this space, you can grow papaya, or even a crop that is not grown in a year or two, or a crop that is not grown in a year or two, or a crop that is not grown in a year or two, or a crop that is not grown in a year or two, you can take a crop that is demultitionally grown. One can take a crop that is demultitionally grown, but it will not stay there 5 years. One can take it, but not very better, because if unwanted weeds grow in future, you can take a ears of that without any atenuometer. You can take a tractor, maintain it, and in 5 years, a flower will be a little cushioned. a cover, your head cover, and let it grow in such a way, so the As I said in Survival Earlier, sandals will suit the dr drylands Now the question arises, Sir, is it possible to get a cup mandi? In Vijapur, there is a cup mandi. Is it possible to get a cup mandi? They have made a low sandal here. But what happens there? There is a small clay in the cup mandi. When the clay is dry, the cracks are formed. When the cracks are formed, the tree's bear is exposed to air. When the air is exposed, the bear stands on the sandal. It is bent. The growth is bent. What does it do? If someone is standing on the sandal, when the cracks are formed, the disc is operated and the sand is crushed. Do you understand? They give irrigation. There is a situation to manage all this. But when the cap is broken, no problems are seen. This is what you have to understand. Next, there is another line. This line is the middle. In this line, if you are standing 5 meters away, you can get a neem plant. You can get it ready. Because this crop will cross the road. That crop will have a root. The neem plant will also go this way. It will supply nutrients. If it gets a neem plant, I will show you the photo. Do you understand? You have to stand like this. No, no. You have to stand like this. What I am saying is, Sir, I am saying that no matter what tree you come from, there is no danger of other trees dying. It is sandalwood. Do you understand? Because if that tree dies, you will not get lost. But sandalwood is not easy. It is very difficult. If that tree dies, it will be sandalwood. Do you understand? What is the need to supply nutrients to a tree that is sandalwood? Pay attention to that. Here, you have been here for 5 years. Now, your tree is dying. The surrounding tree will be a little further away. In that space, if you have planted 4 plants, you will be growing them. You will be producing them. In between, there is no space. Between those 4 plants, you have to plant a permanent host. The permanent host can be a farm, or a vendor. If you have 20 years, you can plant some other plants. You can select the high yielding dwarf varieties and keep them ready. Do you understand? If you want to grow forest crops, or timber, timber is used as sandalwood. This also requires more competition. That is why, the primary product is wood. This is the primary product, wood. So, there is competition between the two products. If you plant it on the ground, like in Srinivaspur, you have to plant it in the ground. What happens there? The tree will be bigger. It will give you more energy. There is no trouble. There is no problem. If you plant fruit crops, you will get less yield. But this is not a problem. If you plant tree crops, you will get good yield. Another thing is the milled oak tree. Milled oak trees are very popular. Milled oak trees will be taken away, they will get dark in 4-5 years, sandalwood will need a whistle, it will get dark, it will not give a whistle. If you plant it, someone will get it. If you plant it, sandalwood will fall out. If you plant it, the tree will fall out. If you plant it, the tree will fall out. If you plant it, the tree will fall out. So, because of all these problems, management is very important. For that, we have a jungle tree, if we plant it, it will get 15 years of yield. If we plant it, we will get 15 years of yield. There is a concept. It is not sensitive. You don't damage barks. Bark is a protective layer. If you block the bark, it will go inside and get more. There is a reason for that. Another thing is, even if you plant it 5-5 meters, when the branches spread, the tractor movements will stop. If you go to a small tree, and the tractor doesn't damage, it is okay. If the tractor damages, it will stop. Did you hear our plantation? Did you hear about Madhagiri? Did you hear about it? There, 17 years ago, we had an advertisement. We did videos and took photos. It was very bad. Because, they expected 10 kg yield. It was not wrong. But what did they do? When they did the tractor operation, we didn't see it. The water entered from the well. The water was very hot. Did you do it? Yes. What did you do? These are our lessons. I didn't come up with any new ideas. I saw Kannara, and I heard about the other guys and I will tell you. Because, so many ideas haven't come to the book yet. Understood? So, take these very carefully and take time every day or once a week, and stand in every room and see the condition, what is the problem. Then you will see, there are many solutions in your local.

 Motivationalmay should create entireM Such a stupid person gave entry into our story Tanda. As soon they term hey, did you lock up the прош? b unknowns P notified 완 чe p After his death, the brave soldiers march towards the last village of Andhra, Aranya. Some of the smugglers of Andhra and Tamilnadu, from there, they will wipe out the blood moon. Red sandal, Godamu. The blood moon in Andhra's last village, Aranya, marches towards Tamilnadu and Kerala. It's not that easy. The Andhra government has created a special security force to track the smugglers of blood moon. Two years ago, 20 blood moon thieves had died in a shootout called STF. But the blood moon thieves' work is not over yet. The blood moon property in the last village, Aranya, should be invested in other states. So, we need to plan for that. We need to get the money we have earned, and get it done quickly. That place is the stronghold. The Kattigana-Halli-Shekada-Tombattarashtra General is talking about the blood moon's death. First, the blood moon thieves were being killed inside the houses of the village. When the Andhra police were in power, the blood moon thieves were being sold by selling blue cloths. How and how did the smugglers of blood moon kill the blood moon? We went to the village one night. Kattigana-Halli is not a big city like Pakistan. The people of one village are more here. We were suspicious that the blood moon thieves were working there. When we talked to some people there, we didn't think that there was a scary atmosphere. A group of people were standing there. We went with them and ran away. We changed our ways. We started to act as if we needed the blood moon. We slowly started to work. Then we saw that the Kattigana-Halli-Shekada-Tombattarashtra was the real murder. Can you find the blood moon in West End? They do it. They do it. It's a secret. But it's a secret to them? Yes. They don't believe that it's a secret. We don't believe it. Can you find the blood moon in West End? Yes. We don't have more blood moon. 10% But you are from Andhra. What's your name? Baba. I don't know where you are from. I don't know if you have a phone number. I will call you if I get one. I don't know. I will call you if I get one. Somwara Siguna gave his mobile number. The day he told me, I went to Kattigana-Halli. I was confident that I would get it. But the dealer took me there. I was terrified. I called the number he gave me. His number was switched off. I thought I could get it. I could turn on my mobile. I was scared. I was scared. I was scared. Cost McCoy told his palms of fear. The dealer told again. Collect my blood moon. It will send into Lord Shiva's Arch. Next I will send it. Concentrate on my plans. The boy went to Sirawada. The woman we followed was looking for. You should look done for. The same words that we heard when we went to the water pool. Which village are you from? Did you come yesterday? Did you come in the same car again? These are the questions that we were asked. They were talking in their language. One of them called the officer. When he saw something, 20 people with moustache came. The officers were Andhra police or Mahitya Dharam. First they buried their lives and then they called it a nunana. If there were people, we were three. They were 20. What to do? This is the only thing that we were able to do. Sir, go left. Go to the main road. Go to the main road. Where is the car? Go. Where is the car? Go. When so many people came to the water pool, we were shocked. We somehow managed to escape from them. We thought this was the only way. We jumped into the water pool and went to the main road. We came to the place where our car was parked and started to walk. We thought we would survive and for a minute, we were following the same path. If we had thought that we should not be involved in this story and came back to Bangalore, we would have been hit by four or five bikes. They would have followed us for about 12 kilometers. We were returning to Bangalore. But they didn't just follow us, they even planned to kill us. Should we just sit back and watch? We will tell you what happened after a short break.

 No Comment No doubt It was too bad no chance We are again following them to see what happens next. So, you see what happened next. When we were being beaten up, we went back to the office thinking that we don't want to be part of this story. But when we started to see this, we followed them with a U-turn. We followed the bikes. The bikes went to the gate. We put the bike on the side. They put the bike on the side. At the same time, the police came to the gate and told us not to go near the town. We were shocked to hear the reason for that. The poor man told us the story of the town. BASE56 When I first went, people were so smart because they knew me.

 Five villagers of Beter district, Aura taluk, worked hard to grow the trees of Sri Gandha. The farmers were thinking of building trees of Sri Gandha that had been growing for about 10-15 years. Now, the farmers are starting a new generation. Let's see what kind of generation it is. In the land where the trees of Sri Gandha were planted, the farmers were able to grow Sri Gandha trees in the forest. What can Sri Gandha do without the stone? What you are seeing now is the view of the villages around Beter district Aura taluk. The farmers worked hard to grow the trees of Sri Gandha. The trees of Sri Gandha were grown in the lands here. Some farmers even planted the trees of Sri Gandha. But the farmers did not know where the tree of Sri Gandha was planted. The trees that had been planted here are now being turned into stone. The farmers are now trying to find a way to get the trees of Sri Gandha to the forest. The minimum number of trees that were planted here was 16-18 kg. After 13 years of growing, we have no security whatsoever. We do not have the marketing knowledge to change the trees. We have wasted so much of our time. At night, the farmers are going to the forest with the help of machines to grow the trees of Sri Gandha. The farmers are now able to grow the trees of Sri Gandha. The farmers who were in the land are now able to grow the trees of Sri Gandha. The farmers are now able to grow the trees of Sri Gandha by showing the same trees of Sri Gandha the next day. The farmers are now able to grow the trees of Sri Gandha. The farmers have been working for 10 years to grow the trees of Sri Gandha. But the fruits of their labor are not good. The farmers are struggling with so many problems. They are trying to grow the trees of the forest in the future. But the farmers are not able to do anything. The police have to take the trees of the forest and put them in the forest. Otherwise, the farmers who are in the forest right now can't do anything. The police have to be careful not to spread the smell of the forest. If the forest is cut down and the farmers are put in the forest, the farmers will be affected. The police have to be careful not to spread the smell of the forest. Suresh Nayak, TV 9, Bidar.

Single square feet of your land should not be wasted. It has the value. Turn left. Your home will be on the right side. Welcome to Rayachur district. Welcome to Kavitha, Sivarathalukku, Rayachur district. This is Kalamadhyama YouTube channel. You can watch it. We have come to Kavitha Mishra Farm. He is a sandalwood farmer and has a lot of amazing skills. He has a new idea for agriculture. We are going to talk to him. We are going to see his farm. This is the way from Rayachur to Bagalkot. This is the way from Bagalkot to Rayachur. There is a town called Kavitha. It is 2 km away from there. Welcome to Kavitha Mishra Farm. Welcome. As I said earlier, Kavitha Mishra is here. Greetings. How are you? I am fine. We are proud of you. I am happy to have accepted your tour. Thank you. There was a time when there was no news on social media. Now there is news. There are people who have learned about your past. Who are you to tell the whole story? I am Kavitha Muma Shankara Mishra. I am from Tavuramani, Dharwad. I am from Rayachur district of Kavitha. I got married here. I got my education and got married in Dharwad. I am doing agriculture and animal husbandry here. I got married in a small village. I had no heart to get married in this village. I had no opportunity to work outside. My husband told me that he will show me what he does inside the house. First of all, I didn't see any cycle coming inside. This is the same place? Yes. I had to sleep outside. There was a hole. Nothing was visible. Half of the wall was not visible. There was a hole like that. A rock hole? Yes. Nothing was visible. There was no way to come inside. There was a small path on the wall. It was very narrow. We had to walk on the small path on the wall. That was the way. We tried for 13-14 years to get to this level. Oh, really? Nothing was visible. When we started, there was no light in the village. No electricity? No. We started in the same way. People were afraid that we might die here. There was such a atmosphere. Nothing was visible. I had to bring a bottle of water from the village. There was no water. This was a very bad land. Nothing was visible. There was no parallel land. There was only stones and stones. We had to make it parallel and level. We brought water from Kanyakumari to Kanyakumari. We made it from 1 inch to 6,000 liters. Within 8 acres. 1 inch water. We had to fill the bottle with water. The water was very low. We made it within 1 inch. 8 acres? Yes. Within 1 inch? Yes. Oh, God. You are an Infosys employee. Yes. What is your qualification? I completed my Diploma in Computer Science. I completed my MA in Sociology from Karnataka University. I had a programming skill. I was selected as a programmer. But I didn't have the opportunity to work outside my husband's house. I didn't get a job. Then I thought about what I should do. I wanted to live in the middle of the four hills. I wanted to achieve something in my life. When I asked my husband, he said, I will get married and I will do anything. You know the temperature here is 45 degrees. We don't have a door. It was very difficult to accept such a challenge in this temperature. I accepted and started. Many problems came. Then one day, I had a different desire. I had lost hope. I saw that day. I did all this in 2010. Did you have a happy experience? No. You didn't have a family? No. I didn't have a good job. I didn't know anything. I didn't have anything to do. I didn't have a fertile land. I didn't have a source of water. I wanted to do something new. I did the first thing. I did the first thing. You didn't have a fertile land. The water was very low. I needed six months of water to get the water. Then I went to the stress center. I didn't need water. Then I went to the forest. I got the rate of the water. But after two years, the water level dropped. My consultant said that I should remove the houses. I thought that if I had to raise children, I would be sad. I felt that I had to take care of my children. I thought about it. I had to go to the stress center in a minute. I cut the grass and the land and the water. You had to do it again. You had to do it again. Yes. I wanted to do something different. That's what I planned. I wanted to do something different. That's what I planned. I wanted to do something different. Agriculture. We have not done it alone, sir. The monocropping method was a different one. Single-billet? Yes. Now I have done integrated farming, sir. On a material basis. What happens in that, sir? On a material basis, we are eating all the different cultures. That is why we call it a material basis. There is agriculture, sir. There is farming. There is agroforestry. There is animal welfare. Why I am saying this is because, agriculture is short-term. For example, the wheat. From 3 to 4 months, the rice is from 5 to 6 months, sir. It can be jola, togri, shenga, kadli, ullagaddi or manasinaka. This is agriculture. Short-term. What I have done in that is, I have done horticulture, that is mid-term. That is, we get the rice from 1 to 10, 15 years, and we get it from there. For example, if we do it in the name, it can be from 1 acre to 5 to 6 tons in a year. We get it in the name, sir. It can be L49, Taiwan pink, Taiwan white. It can be done quickly. If we do it in the name, it can be done for 3 years, sir. It can be kesar, dasari, mallika, banganpalli. I have done 4 varieties of mangoes in my own way, sir. If I do it in one way, the yield will not come for another year, sir. It will fluctuate. It can be done in a climatic condition or we can do it in practices. We have done pehra, mao, sethappal, betta nellika, neerlana, unusiyana, and then we have done karibeo, nimbeana, mousambi. This is the method of harvest based on the type of the crop. Every type of crop should have its own characteristics. I have harvested the srikandha. I am telling everyone that I have harvested the srikandha in Karnataka. But since the year 2012, we have not been able to see the srikandha for 15 years. We are all in the middle of the road. We have a difficult life. It is not a poem. All the Karnataka and Indian farmers have been killed. Why am I saying this? Because the srikandha is a parasite. It requires the host. So, when we need a host, we need to prepare a good srikandha and it should be a good food for us. We need to support the srikandha and we need to develop it. The farmers need to survive. How does it work if the farmers have srikandha for 12 to 15 years? For example, if a man is 18 to 25 years old, I will ask him to leave his job and do farming. He will ask me one question. He will ask me if I get my salary on Monday and retirement pension on Monday. This system is set for that. Agriculture, horticulture, agroforestry, animal husbandry. Four combinations. We have planned all the combinations. Then we will not have a problem of srikandha farming. I thought of that. I thought it was practical and I took success from it. I have seen the srikandha farm from the beginning. It is a 9 year old farm. I will show you what I do for the 9 years. The srikandha farm has not grown at all. Because the srikandha farm has a lot of problems. It is a mixed farm. There is a lot of problems. What is the rate of srikandha? What is the future? What is the use? What are the consequences? There are many questions about how to become a farmer. There are many questions. There are many questions. I have seen many questions. I will tell the farmer. We have done all the work. We have done all the work. We have seen one crore. None of us have seen. None of us have seen. That is the truth. Another thing is that When we talk about the farm, there are no pictures of the farm. This is a terrible truth. This is a terrible truth. You are famous on YouTube and Facebook. But there are no pictures of the farm. The farmers' lives are not that colourful. It is very terrible. How terrible is it? Let us talk about the tractor. One tractor costs 800 to 900 rupees. One cow. I will get one cow. One cow costs 1700 rupees. One cow costs 500 rupees. One cow costs 300 rupees. We don't have the money to buy a tractor. We don't have the money to buy a tractor. We have to buy it ourselves. After all this, what do we get in the end? What do we get in the end? What do we get in the end? The farmers will pay the taxes. That is our new year. We will pay the taxes. We have spent so much. We have got what we need. What do we get in the end? We will flop. We will write the year. We will write the year. The cost of cultivation will be increased. The income will be reduced. The farming will be reduced. The farming will be reduced. Because they both are not proportional to each other. Because they both are not proportional to each other. It is a serious matter. It is a serious matter. Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi says Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi says In 2022, we should double the income. In 2022, we should double the income. In 2022, we should double the income. If the income is zero, if we double it, it will be zero. If we multiply zero into zero, If we multiply zero into zero, it is zero only. It can't be infinite. If we want to go for the infinite, This is the right time to think over it. This is the right time. That is why I say, that is why I say, Because every year, the population is getting poor. The land is getting poor. That is the state. The land is there. If we want to grow the land, If we want to start it, if we want to get the creativity, from the youngsters, because our knife is over, tomorrow it is in your hands. That is why today, I will tell you what Grow Forestry is. It has become the need of the day. It has become the need of the day. Because, what everyone says, we are calculating this for MSP. Minimum supporting price. Minimum supporting price. Minimum supporting price. We are considering this. What do you consider in that? You, the government, our people, our families, our work, our expenses, our food, medicine, cow dung, how much is the total expense, everyone considers that much. Then, our land is getting ruined. You are saying that because the land is not there. You tell me. If the land is there, you will cultivate it. If the land is not there, you will be living in cities. You will not be living in a single bedroom for 600 sq. ft. Then, where will our land be ruined? Where will our rental charges be? There is no way that it will be done. Then, who will calculate it? No one will calculate it. I selected Agroforestry to calculate it. I told you, this is Srikanth's long term crop. What did I say? If we are planting Srikanth from 2012 to 2015, how much land will we have to pay? Till then, it is a dead investment. Dead investment, sir. I wanted to support Agroforestry so that the land would be worth it. I wanted to support Agroforestry because if we plant Srikanth, you will know that it will not grow fast. We have to stay for 15 years. If we have to stay for 15 years, the farmer should be strong and have a strong will. I have done this for that. In my village, we have planted 8-10 acres of Srikanth, 600 sq. ft. of sorghum, 600 sorghum, 100 bett, 300 water, 100 honey, 100 lime, 100 lime, 100 curry leaves, 100 time. I will give you another chance to make 50 rupees. Because you have made 50 rupees. So what I am saying is, earning is not important, saving is important. So you should not spend your land on waste, spend it on waste, go with nature. Don't go against nature. But if you go with nature, you will have to do something for the poor. I have tried that. Water is my weakness. I knew that from the beginning. Because this is a rice field. I tried very hard but I could not get water. After I knew that water is my weakness, I told you many times, Water, water, water, flour, flour, water is not good. I knew that weakness because the water in the river is very low. Major non-crop is Srikandha. When water is left in Srikandha, there is no oil. The more water you reduce, the more oil content is left in Srikandha. Why? Because Srikandha is not good for the farmers. It is good in the forest. It is good in the forest because it doesn't require special care and maintenance. Because there is no need for water. Because there is no need for labour. In the worst case, the only good thing is Srikandha. That is why I tell the farmers, If you do what you do, do it technically. Don't go to the river to get water. Then you should not give the water to the farmer. It should not be more than Srikandha. Because if you give the water to the farmer, what will happen? If you give the Srikandha water, it should be more than Srikandha. If you give the Srikandha water, it should be more than Srikandha. Because the sun doesn't rise. So, there is no need to be a scientist. We learn to do our own work. That is why I tell the farmers, If you want to do your own work, I will give you Srikandha. I am not saying that Srikandha is a pioneer. But I will say one thing. I have experienced a lot from my 10 years journey. Even if I am a barrier, I will not give you the water. Because I have been telling this for a long time. I have to do my daily work. I have to manage the host, water, pest control, nutrition. I have to give all these things. I have been learning all these things day by day. I tell this to the farmers. Because if we do something like Facebook or YouTube, I feel that we will not get that much success. Where ever you go, there is no rain. You can't grow Srikandha. So, you think there is no Srikandha? Nothing can be grown. There should be rain in the soil. The soil should be ready for every stage. The sun should be ready. The sun should be ready. The sun should be ready for the sun to rise. It should be ready for rain, for snow. It should be ready for cold and for wind. No need for money. You won't get the results. You can't put people. If you put people, you will have people. If you work as a boss, you will have people. That is my experience. I understood and faced it practically. Thank you.

 Hi India, so today I am in Bangalore. Actually the rarest of rare person we are interviewing with personality regarding Sandalwood. Actually in recent days Sandalwood is booming a lot, you all know that right? So that's why the rarest of rare person, now I have come to Bangalore to interview. So we have Ananth Padmanabhan here. Hello sir. Hello. So we have come to interview with him. Actually he is the father of Sandalwood. So with them we will learn Sandalwood cultivation, nursery and some tips. So come. Sir, Sandalwood is a very rare thing. What is your opinion sir? Sandalwood is now becoming a very rare thing. In Karnataka we call it as Gandhandagudi. Now it is called as Durghandagudi. So it is a very rare thing. In the past we used to get around 4,000 to 5,000 tonnes of sandalwood. Now the situation is that we are not getting more than 20 tonnes of sandalwood. And no one is even selling the oil. In Karnataka we have to get around 20 to 80 tonnes of sandalwood. So they use the oil themselves. No one is giving it to them. The reason why this is happening is that we are getting more and more sandalwood from our country. The forest department has not lost so much. In Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and other places, we have not lost so much sandalwood. There is a lot of demand for sandalwood. If we want to meet that demand, we have to participate privately. We have to grow sandalwood even if it is private. If we grow it as much as possible, it will be very helpful for the sandalwood industry. Sir, if it is a private industry, do you need to get permission? Or can everyone grow it? No one is getting permission to grow sandalwood. In Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, they have amended the forest policy. The amendment was made and everyone can grow sandalwood. After that, the sandalwood is grown and the sandalwood is taken care of. But to build it and to work on it, the forest department has to do it. That is a very bad thing. Even we have grown our private land here. They should have some kind of right. The forest department has given us a certificate to grow sandalwood. If we study this in agriculture, we can change it for everyone. The land is very much in need of research. They are going to do it. They should be more careful. The government has taken care of this. They have given us government rules to change it for everyone. The farmers are growing sandalwood. They grow it and save it. If they save it and give it to us, they will also get the bill. We cannot get the bill from them. We have to make sure that the policy is followed by the rules. Basically, the Karnataka government is supporting this. Do each state have its own rules? Do all states have the same rules? No, even if they have the same rules, the forest department is a state subject. They have their own rules. Karnataka and Tamilnadu are on the same page. They don't have any state to decide on the rules. They have their own rules. Only Karnataka and Tamilnadu have the same rules. People are talking about the seeds. The first question is how to get permission. Many people are down on the idea of not growing sandalwood. Another question is, what is the seed? Many people have doubts. What is your opinion? According to the old forest system, the trees should be well planted. That's why they are taking the seeds. That's a mistake. Because when a tree is in bloom, it should be replanted and grown. We don't want to lose 22 years. We have collected the seeds that are coming in 4 or 5 years. We will use them for cultivation. The Oxford dictionary has a TLA. It says that when a tree starts to bloom, it is reproductively matured. We can use the seeds to grow the seeds. We can prepare for that. We don't have any other way. We have to take 25 years to get the trees. It is difficult to get them. We can plant them in the nursery. We can get the seeds from the nursery. We can also get the seeds from the nursery. We can get the seeds from the nursery. I have a seed that is not in the IWSD. I have compared the seed with the one that is not in the IWSD. The IWSD seed is bigger. The seed that is grown on the outside is smaller. What is the difference? We have studied the seeds. We have made the seeds into three types. Small, medium and big. We have made them into three types. Even if we take the medium, it will yield good results. We have taken the seeds from the nursery. We have dried them. That gives us good results. Small seeds are better than big ones. What is the assumption? If the seed is big, it yields good results. That is wrong. If the seed is big, it yields good results. If the seed is small, it yields less results. That is not the reason for germination. Can we get the seeds from the nursery? Yes, we get the seeds from the nursery. We get them in April. We get them in September and October. We can get the seeds from the nursery. You are doing the nursery. How much of a kilo of seed can you get? We get 5 to 5.5 thousand seeds from a kilo of seed. That is a good number. But 50% of the seeds are germinated. We get 50% of the seeds from the nursery. When we plant the seeds, we put all the seeds in the seed bed. We treat them with the help of the seed bed. When we plant the seeds, we get 50% of the germination. We get 50% of the germination. We can absorb the water and give it to the seed. When we plant the seeds, we get the seeds from the nursery. We can spray the seeds from the nursery. We can give the seeds to the good seeds. When we get the seeds from the nursery, we get the fungus called Fusarium. Then we get the fungus called Pythium. We get the fungus called Nemetode. When we mix the two fungus, it harms the seed. We can easily control the disease. We can easily control the disease.

Namaste, dear viewers. I am Dr. P.K. Praveen Babu. I am a scholar and a philosopher in the field of Ayurveda and Marama. Today's topic is Shrikandha. Shrikandha was born in Karnataka in the year of Heralavai. Today it is Virala. Shrikandha has a religious status that is not appropriate for it. In our Pooja rituals, Shrikandha has a very high status. Why? Because the Lord has given the quality of living in the forest. So, Shrikandha has a religious status. What is the purpose of Shrikandha? Before using Shrikandha as a medicine, we should first see the qualities of Shrikandha. This is not Shrikandha, viewers. This is the Shita-Virya-Dravya. It is the Dravya that gives the body the strength and strength. Then, how should we use Shrikandha? By giving the smell of Shrikandha to the body, it is possible to use Shrikandha. This is the Shita-Virya-Dravya. This is the Dravya that gives the body the strength and strength. This is the Shita-Virya-Dravya. This is the Dravya that gives the body the strength and strength. This is the Dravya that gives the body the strength and strength. We have seen in our practice that even the skin diseases are getting worse. There is no such thing as a partial effect. Instead of using the same chemical concept of Shrikandha, to clean the rem cardio irrigation or purification of the https pleaseую We make Shrikandha oil only in erstmal. In the treatment of skin diseases, the skin diseases and the wounds that have come from the skin are being tolerated. In this way, we can save and grow the tree of Srikanth in our daily life. Thank you for listening to this video.

 So now I am putting increment borer to test the hot wood formation in the sun root tree. It is around 4 and half year old tree and girth is around 40 cm. And I am putting increment borer to remove the core sample to test the hot wood of the tree. So now I am putting increment borer. It is going inside and after that we remove the core sample. So in that core sample we can test the hot wood as well as sharp wood. Spoon please. Now I have applied spoon and removing the core sample. So you will know what is the extent of hot wood here?

 This is a grill that we have been using for the last 7-8 years. If we make it in a ten feet height, it will cost us around 8-10 lakh rupees. So, no need to worry. It will cost us around 3-4 lakh rupees to make this grill. If we do not have safety, we cannot cut it and use it as a grill. So, we can make a one-room flat and use it for the next 8 years. After that, if we do a grill like this for the next 8 years, we will definitely get a 10 lakhs worth of water. So, no need to worry. If we make a one-room flat for every house, we will definitely get a good quality one. We will get a good quality one.

 A complete video about Blackwood will be uploaded. Many people have doubts about how to build it and where to build it. We will talk about that in the next video. Since we are making a video today, this is a very important video. We will discuss about the damage done in the last 3 years. How the sand was taken by the people who walked around the area in 1 feet. Let's talk to this farmer. Basically, it's been 3 years. Yes, 3 years. How deep is it? Nearly about 1 feet. More than 1 feet. The main reason is the host. Here is the bunny. We showed in the last video how the bunny was taken down. It was sitting alone. Today, you can see that it is lying down. It is locked. Basically, what is happening here is that it is not planned to be put down. It is naturally taken down. But there is a tree there. You can see that. 3 feet. This is the key. This is also 3 years old. People don't believe it. I am not saying this. That's why I am asking the writer. Sir, come here. Please give an introduction. Basically, he is an agri diploma. He is a full-time farming type. The people who are interested in this are 11 acres. They are developing one acre. They are developing their own land. Please give an introduction about when you started your first agri diploma. My name is Vishwanath Nagar. I am from Balakot district. This is 11 acres of land. We have grown rice and rice. Next is lime. This is lime. This is lime. Next is lime. This is lime. Next is lime. Next is lime. Next is lime. Next is lime, lime. The first agri diploma was the first one. The first one. How many acres did you put? 3 acres. They started from there. They had to enter this Arunakrishi area. And in 2019, they started Shrikanth and Akare Teek. 2 of them were there. In this plot, Srikant has brought it in the plot, the Hebbia plot. There he has brought tea. For tea, forest department. Our sandal is also the same. Forest department has brought it. Along with this, they are growing rice. What is the distance between the rice and the tea? Sir, the distance is 10 feet. 10 feet, sandal to sandal, row to row, space to yard, same. 10 bettons, means 430 plants per acre. In between, they are growing rice. That is 5 feet. 5 feet. They have planted a rice plant every 5 feet. That too from 2019. Same, sir. That was a year ago. Rice plant. First they planted 10 bettons. Then they started planting sandal. So, plant to plant.

If you want to have a good formation of the heart, you need to have constant stress and consistency. Consistency means to be in a constant connection. You need to be in constant stress. You need to be in constant contact. If you just get stuck in the middle of the mountain, and before that, if you have targeted the mountain for 15 years, if you want to cut it, then there is a chance for a heart attack. It is extremely healthy, right? It is good in the initial stage, but if you maintain it like that, it will be wrong. So, we will discuss with sir what to do about secondary metabolism. This is the first time I have seen this. This is the fourth year since I came here. What these trees have done is, they have drained the extreme nutrients from the sand. It means that the fruits of all the trees are coming from different places. I will put some different species of fruits here. This tree is almost 4 and a half years old. It is 3 and a half years old. It has already taken all the energy to grow up to 4 years old. You can see the side of the tree. It is almost healthy. It is healthy and strong. It is called a marine tree. It is a good place to grow. If there is no secondary host, then a permanent host will be given. I have given some coconut. One advantage is that it has grown a lot. It has grown 3-4 feet. It has grown a lot. After one year, it has grown a lot. After one year, it has grown a lot. It has grown a lot. It has grown a lot. Did you give anything to the root zone? No, I did not give anything. I did some irrigation in the summer. You did not give water in the summer? No, I did not give water. If there is no water, then it can be used once or twice. What I am saying is that the leaf density of the leaves is much less. You have already seen it. If you want to see the difference between the two, look at this tree. How many leaves is there in this tree compared to this tree? Even if there are only two trees, photosynthesis activity will be definitely less in this tree. The growth of the leaves will be stunned if the time is like this. growth the size of the leaves will also be bigger in length and in comparatively so if you have that much boost up the soil okay boost up the soil so that you know the size of the leaves so the leaves have dropped here here, full leaf has dropped okay now in another year all this will go in the trash it will go back it has almost gone now if you cut it, it will come back yes yes it is not getting smaller it has grown so much okay but it is not good to cut it from inside what happened sir? it is not good because it is in the center it is not good it is a big problem inside it is all dead inside it is all dead okay okay at night it is all dead we both came here okay so now you have left the plant yes now you have already seen with the smell they have planted it in the field the smell in the field is weak but here you can see the border the plants in the field why is it so beautiful the answer is the light the light is very important if you want to smell it you have to plan it from the beginning that is why I am making this video the second idea is the host is not enough you are watching this is our beehive and our bunny how beautiful it is because the bunny beehive is big it is very strong because of the light it has been growing for 3 years it is 1 feet long if the farmer tries this is the minimum I always say don't cut the tree too much it is not important to cut 1000 trees you can cut 100 trees and make it in a good size or you can cut it in a good way okay so the purpose of this video is to help the farmer with a little knowledge light, nutrients and host don't count the three and go on the number don't put 200 or 600 they put 400 the result is not there because it is very strong and the host is dying remember this let's continue the video micro nutrients and DIP DIP is not given in the beater DIP is also there for the year planting time nothing is given

 We have given the money to the government. Otherwise, we would not have been able to survive. So, we have been waiting for 15 years for the money to be given to Srikanth. So, we have to make sure that we have the money to support Srikanth. We have to pay the same amount of money. We have done this for the first time. Srikanth is weak because of the bad conditions of the land. He has been suffering for the last two years. He is weak because of the bad conditions of the land. You have to understand that when your land is weak, it is a clue of nature. Your heart would have been done. You are at the right direction of the land load cultivation. You should have that experience. I have demonstrated this with my friends. I have demonstrated this with my friends. I have demonstrated this with my friends. What I have done is the same as the other side. The road zone is deep. Srikanth is facing problems. He is not able to stand on the side. I have done this for him. I have done this for him. This is the state. It is enough for two years, but it is weak. If you want ketchup, you have to take it. But if you don't get it, ketchup will not be available. Ketchup is a good start for us. First we have to pay the rent. In the last seven years, I have done everything. I have done everything like medicine. 0 cultivated land. Why? Because the route of Srikanth is very wide. People think that they can grow stem. But the route of Srikanth is 3 times bigger than the stem. Oil content is higher than that. And the route of Srikanth is 6% oil content. Whereas in other states it is not 1-2%. Why I am doing this for Karnataka is because the land has already given you the gift of God. Nature has stopped you but you don't understand. And then you say, how many years from now, how will you get the land? How should you leave it like that? Because the route of Srikanth is not inside. If one jerk goes with your tractor, it thinks that I am in city. You should create a boundary for that. How much ever you try, it will fall. So you should do it naturally? Yes, we should do it artificially. Srikanth has given us a lot of water. We have given him a lot of water. Because there is water in it. If you give him water, it will be full. So from the initial stage, Srikanth has given us less water. After 7-8 years, we should stop the water. We should stop the water completely. The more water you stop, the bigger the water you will get. Srikanth should be strong. That is the biggest strength. Another thing is, if you don't have a good water, you will get a lot of water. Especially during rainy season. If you get a lot of water during rainy season, excess water will get in. Srikanth will have to take a lot of water. If you clean it, the water will go away. If you have a big hole in the wall, if you let the water go, you will get water. You should do this, according to me. How long should it be? We have only 1-2 inches of water. We don't have water. We can save 8000 kgs of water. We should stop the water after 10-15 years. We should stop the mulching. Then we can live a good life. We should stop the water. If we stop the water, the soil will not be good. Our food will not be good. I am telling you, you don't have to do smart work. No labour, no coconut, no water. We are here to help Bangalore Mysore. We can do this work. This is organic farming. We have done all the work. We have done all the work. We don't need any labour. After 7-8 years, we have stopped the selling. We have to run the money. We have to do something. I am a farmer. I am a farmer. I am a farmer. I am a farmer. I am a farmer. I am a farmer. I am a farmer. I am a farmer. You have planted the seedlings? No, I do not plant the seedlings. I plant the seedlings on the top of the hill. I do not plant the seedlings. The seedlings will be planted on the top of the hill. It will not cause damage to your field. Did you plant the leaves? No sir. At the initial stage, I did not plant any seedlings. I did not plant any wild vegetables. I planted them after 5 years. I started this business in 2013 and now I am in 2015. This time I am in 2014. So what I am telling you is, whatever we do, we are in debt. We are in debt for 600 rupees. We are in debt for 300, 200, 200 rupees. We have been in debt for a long time. We have not been able to pay the debt. So what will happen if we do this? If you do not do anything, you will get a loan. If you do not do anything, you will get a loan. And you will get support from the government. So you should know when to do anything. I did not do anything in the initial stage. They will eat my chicken. I did chicken after 5 years. They eat my chicken. I will show you. They eat my chicken. They eat my chicken. So it helps you. I will feed them once. I will feed them once. I will feed them once. You will get good results. Another thing is, Balashtra people are afraid of the It is My I am not saying that.

You will not serve the land, you will not clean the houses, you will not do any work You will not give legal market to the government to build the roads You will not give brown sugar, you will not give sugarcane, you will not do anything Why are you asking my question again? Madam, one thing, one bit of work for the future I want to ask you a question, you have a contribution from your side Because all these things are not in the nature, these are the anger Why are you not in the nature? Because nature is not in the nature Now it is time, you are not contributing to nature, what wrong you will do? So when you do this, what wrong you will do? Why Veerappan became famous today? Because Sreegandha Kalumadana became famous when Sreegandha Kalumadana was made Now when Kalla became famous, Beladoni became famous That is the reason why I am not in the nature Kalla became strong because you are not strong You forgot your capability This revolution should not happen alone If Bhagat Singh was saying that he will die, when would we get freedom? We would not get freedom We should be brave and not think about our village We should think about our own future Today you are doing a lot of work for the country Karnataka is a dirty country, small village That revolution should happen because of you I will make you strong because I am not an agent or a franchise I am a farmer, I am a farmer, that is why I will make you strong If I had been there, how would you have believed me? It is said that it is impossible to reach Sreegandha Kalumadana in 45 degree temperature But today I proved it Because today each of my trees are at the age of 7 years They have crossed the width of 65 cm which is possible at the age of 15 years So what I am saying is that the land should be even better Because your Malnad is not made by Sreegandha Kalumadana If you come to the top, you should be able to reach one edge Regarding protection aspect, I am telling about the e-protection system What is e-protection system? We put microchip in the middle This is operated through sensors, there is no wire like this Where do the signals come from? Through satellites Then we should connect the world between the ground and the earth For that we give four gateway connections through routers Modern it interacts with only one device whereas router interacts with multi devices One of these connections will be given to IWST server What is IWST? Indian Wood Science Technology They are doing all the trees' research They will give you a drone in this system In that you have day vision camera and dark vision cameras In day vision, whoever comes to you, they will tell you that At night, there is light in every corner and it is not possible to sleep For that, dark vision camera is used Any image that comes from anywhere, it will be automatically altered It will capture black and white image and go to IWST When it is human, it will be like an animal Then they will give you a name plate 1, 2, 3, 4 If you give these 100, it will give you an alert message One for your mobile and one for the nearest police station Then you are not in the village, the building is already destroyed But because of that chip, it will show the location Exactly where your wood is moving in which direction So now you are risk free But now we have to pay 2000 rupees for this For one year, after paying 2000 rupees, they will return it once They will keep it in the luggage for once They will give all these luggage Then we have to pay 100 rupees per month 24 into 7 they are working for us So this is the protection 100 rupees per tree So I am telling the government to give us free of cost So what I am saying is, you have to get a big hedge But if the water is more, how will you grow the grass? How much water will you grow? Actually we don't need water Sir, we have to reduce the water From the initial stage, we have to reduce the water We are reducing the water We don't need water Why I am asking you to increase the water Because we have to increase the water But if the water is more, we can't get water We have to do it scientifically and technically We have to do it with 100 acres We are not that capable But at the end of 12-15 years, you have to see your children Because if they are not able to do it, they will not be able to do it She should also feel proud that I am a wife of a farmer That day should come My struggle is for only that Madam, you said you have maintained one labor Exactly This is 8 acres, we have to pay 8000 rupees for 10 acres One labor But you said you don't have to pay for the grass So you don't need labor I am saying that you don't need labor You can't grow grass in the area where you have planted the DIP You have to give us coconut, coconut, coconut, and coconut You don't need to give anything else We don't need water We don't need water, we have to drip water We have to drip 4 liters per hour for the Srigandha And 10 liters per hour for the farmers They make holes and then they drill So you have to do it in one day We have to do it in a sub-wall 8 acres, 8 sub-walls The water has become less One wall, two walls, three walls, four walls If there is a little water, the front wall will be closed If there is a little water, the pressure will be lost Because I knew my weakness and my weakness I was doing my weakness as my powerpoint Then I was doing my weakness Because we are doing this because we have to eat this Antioxidants are available We can't get the money wherever we are So I was eating the soil of the soil When I was doing my weakness When I was doing my weakness When I was doing my weakness This is natural farming And many other living creatures are also surprised If you clean it, electricity won't come Microorganisms, cells So this is the system I was doing in my house Because we know how to do farming even if the water is less We have come from our hometown to get the labour For the last two years, the capacity of the farmers is very low Because they are very poor So we have to do all these things in one day That's why we are doing this Where did you come from? From Kerala This is your entry-star property Yes, I am an entry-star property We had a small road in the village We had to ride a motorcycle We had a lot of roads When did I start all this?

Will you pass the electricity to the electricity? No, we won't. We won't. We won't do this fencing. I have installed 800 windbreakers around the valley. I have installed 800 windbreakers around the valley. If you do solar fencing, you won't get anything from the valley. It is hurting. If we install windbreakers around the valley, it won't be able to get much air. It won't dry. That's why I have installed windbreakers. That's why I have installed windbreakers. I have installed anti-virus. I should have worked as a medicine specialist. Is this the plant management? Yes, only half of it. Is it safe? Is it safe? Yes. Water is bad. It is not good.

I will tell you why. We can't recognize what everyone has done. We have to pay 20 to 30 rupees. We have to pay 1 to 2 lakh rupees. We don't have to pay 2 lakhs. Even if you have 30 rupees, you can't get a bigger pot. You can get 6 tons from this. We can get 2 lakhs from anywhere. I don't think we should spend 2 lakhs and get 3 lakhs. We can get 2 lakhs from anything. That is natural. We don't need water. We don't need it. We don't need it. We don't need it. We don't need it. This is the Aranya Christian method? Yes, this is the Aranya Christian method. This is natural farming, organic farming, zero budget farming. We don't have to invest anything in zero budget farming. We have to do that. 6 by 6.

Many people from the state came here to learn about Sri Gandhada. They also went to learn about Sri Gandhada and started farming. I had come to work from Africa. They were very happy and gave us seeds for our sample. We planted the seeds, planted them and if anything happens to our land, they promised to give us permission. In Malavi, Vishu Kumar, who was the Ismail Emperor, was informed about Sri Gandhada. In Sri Gandhada, the government of Lalana was allowed to bring Vishu Kumar to his country. Vishu Kumar is still happy about this opportunity. We are very happy about this. In Chipanguru district, Vishu Kumar is a very good farmer. Similarly, I would like to ask the government and Sri Gandhada farmers to help us. I would like to ask them to bring more farmers like Vishu Kumar to their country. Vishu Kumar, who was a millionaire, has become a farmer. He has provided information to other farmers. He has also provided the information to foreigners about our country. I wish Vishu Kumar becomes a farmer like this.

My dream is to beat him. If I am in a dream, I will get a visa for my dream. I will get a permanent contact with the farmers. Different organizations are coming. 100 farmers are coming. They are coming to collect the rice. Every Monday and Tuesday, we have a group discussion. Every farmer has problems with agriculture. What are the do's and don'ts? That's it. That's it. Every Monday and Tuesday, at 9 am, we have a discussion about agriculture. We have a discussion about agriculture. We give them food, feed them, free of cost. We have a discussion. Every Monday and Tuesday, at 9 am, we have a discussion. If you are a farmer, you don't have to do anything for 3 acres. Out of 4 acres, you can do only 1 acre of agriculture. You can do 3 acres of seed production, oil, vegetables, and floriculture. Whatever you do. For your daily expenses, you can do 1 acre of agriculture based on the Srikandha. In that, you can do butter fruit, sesame, and many more. If you do 300 srikandha, you can do 15-20 years of srikandha. We can do it after the middle age. We have a discussion. For 1 acre, we need 10 kg of wheat. For the age of 15, we need 10 kg of wheat. If we have oil content, we can do 10,000 kg of wheat. 1 acre is 1 lakh. 300 acres is 3 crores. I am saying that if you think about it, if you put 3 crores as the state bank, the future of our family, if we get any benefits, if we get any savings, the economic power that comes from that savings will increase. Now, you get a message from the land. There was a time when a man was coming from Srikandha for the 8th year. You get a message from the society.
