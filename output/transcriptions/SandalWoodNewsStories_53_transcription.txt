So now I am putting increment borer to test the hot wood formation in the sun root tree It is around 4.5 year old tree and girth is around 40 cm And I am putting increment borer to remove the core sample to test the hot wood of the tree So now I am putting increment borer I think light smell is there, I think there is the initiation of conversion, hot wood. So there is a color change in the soft wood. So that is the indication of formation of hot wood in the young tree also. Okay, congratulations Vinay. Thank you, thank you. Light has come, still not there, but it started.
