Yes, we have planted some enlightenment plant 500-200 is a good rate. It is secondary, but we can get a small amount of money. If we get half of the money, it is enough. It can be used for long term. What is your budget plan? We don't spend much for this. What is your profession? You are getting the dhalambi. We are getting everything. Why did you do this? This is a 10 years crop. After 10 years we can replant. At the same time, this will also go. After 10 years, we can plant the crop. This crop is multiple years old. We can't believe that this is dhalambi. It is a disease, it is a blight. We can't come here. We need support. If we don't have this, we can't. In banana, there are ups and downs. If we get poly, we can plant. Balance is also there. If we get profit, we can get profit. It is a long term plan. We can't do everything at once. It is better to do everything at once. What did you do? I told you, the rates are low. We can't get profit. It is better to do everything at once. It should be safe. There should be time rotation. In June, yield comes. In October, yield comes. It is good to do seasonal plantations. At least every 3 months, we should have some income. How many 10 years are there? We have 30 acres. We have 30 acres. We are not doing much. Balance is there. There are other ways. We like multi-cropping. We should have something long term. If not, we can do coconut. We are doing present marketing. They prefer natural drinks. In summer, we don't get coconut. We don't get coconut water. We should do something special. We should plant in the fields. We have hybrid seedlings. We have planted for 3-4 years. We can say that we have completed yield. We can also plant other fruits. We have coconut. Since you have children, do you think that they will change? They will change physically. They don't have much. I think they will change physically. They don't have any education. If they don't get a job, they will be agricultural. They will be classed as absence. Do you think it is good to see them? If they are diverted, it will be difficult. They will be safe. They will not be able to pay 10 lakhs. It will be difficult to convince anyone. They will be happy to see them. They will be happy to see them. It is a good thought. Okay sir.
