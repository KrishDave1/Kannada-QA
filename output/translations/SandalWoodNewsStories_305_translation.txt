 From this we can earn around 1,20,000 rupees In the private market, the price of this tree is around 10 to 15 thousand rupees This tree depends on the water and food needs of the tree If we look here, the tree is 5 feet tall and has a good height Greetings to all This is a very valuable tree It is famous in the world for its fragrance This tree is very popular in the national and international market But this tree is very popular in the market The reason is that the cultivation practice of this tree is very good We call this tree as a hemiroot parasite The structure of this tree is not developed properly This tree depends on another tree If you are growing in Srikanth, you need to find a host plant The reason for the formation of the tree is that it does not have the ability to take water, minerals and nutrients This tree depends on the water and nutrients of the tree If we look at the host plants of this tree First of all, agroforest trees Then there are aranya plant plants Then there is the tea tree Then there is the honey tree Then there is the tea tree Then the best host of this tree is the mulberry We can also host the honey trees The host plant you are selecting should not be more than the tree of Srikanth Because the heartwood is very important in Srikanth So to form the heartwood and oil, it needs to be very hot and sunny If we select a very hot tree, it will give us heat Then the heartwood formation will not be possible In that we call the tree of Srikanth as a stress-loving plant If the stress is more, the tree will grow well I told you earlier that if you want to form the heartwood, the tree needs to be hot and sunny So only if you get all these, the tree will grow well The distance is very important to plant the host plant After planting the host plant, you need to put the tree of Srikanth from 2.5 to 3 meters The best host plant for the Srikanth is the leguminous plant The leguminous plant helps to stabilize the environment And it helps to grow enough leguminous plants for the Srikanth There are two types of host plants One is the primary host and the other is the permanent host The primary host is the one that needs to be sown for 6 months to 2 years The next one is the permanent host After 2 years, we need to plant the permanent host The primary host is the one that needs to be sown The secondary host is the one that needs to be sown The primary host can be sown with tea, honey, honey trees or even glyricidia The use of glyricidia and sesbenia will help to grow more species These two plants are the main reason for the growth of these two plants The Srikanth plant is also very useful for the growth of these two plants The main reason for the growth of the Srikanth plant is The tree is a rain-capped tree You should not plant this tree in the water I have already mentioned that If you want to have a heart-wood and oil content formation in this tree You need to have enough light and moisture Otherwise, if you water it too much, it will not form a heart-wood And the quality of the oil content will also be very low If you want to plant the host plant in the Srikanth tree The water content should not be more than 5 feet It should also be rain-capped If you water the host plant too much, it will affect the Srikanth plant If you want the Srikanth plant to grow, the space is also very important Because it is a host plant, we need to give 5 feet space to the host and the Srikanth plant If you give more space than 5 feet, the host plant will not connect with the host plant It will be difficult to get water and moisture We will also show the same example in the same garden If we look here, the tree is growing well because of the 5 feet space If you look at the other tree in the same garden, the growth is not correct Because the host plant is too far away, it is not suitable for the tree to grow We call this tree the wider adaptability crop Because we can grow this tree in any environment If you give 10 feet space to one tree, you can plant 160 trees This tree can grow from 15 to 20 years So, from one tree we can get 20 kg of hardwood Now, in the market rate, we can get 6,000 rupees for one tree If we plant 20 kg of hardwood from one tree, we can get 1,200,000 rupees So, if we plant 160 trees per acre, we can get 2 crores of money from 160 trees In between the trees, we can plant papaya, lemon, cardamom, and cinnamon We can get money from them But if we want to grow this tree, the main problem is that it will be stung We can take this tree and go So, we have to give protection to this tree Because of the production of this tree, the government is supporting the tree The Government of Karnataka has also supported the project Grow More Sandalwood To protect this tree, we have to protect this tree by using microchips To protect this tree, the government has a protection system This is to protect trees by using microchips We can take 8 feet of wood from the ground and put it in the trees This is done by Indian Wood Science and Technology So, if a stone comes to your garden, there will be a drone, night vision camera, day vision camera When someone comes to your garden, they capture the images in the camera There is a server in the microchip, and the server is connected to Indian Wood Science and Technology If someone comes to your garden, they will also get a signal When you cut the tree and take it, you can even track the stone If you want to protect this protection system in your garden, you should put at least 100 trees But this is dependent on the government If you want to do it yourself, you can put a sharp stone around it If a stone is too sharp, it will not be cut easily If a stone is 40-50 feet long, it will not be seen even if the tree is cut by the government You can also use other methods to protect the trees You can use a barbed wire to protect the trees You can also use a barbed wire to protect the trees If you put dogs in your garden, they will also protect the dogs You can also install a CCTV camera Since this tree is expensive, the government has also provided the facilities If you want to buy a seedling, you can get it at a subsidy rate of 3-5 rupees You can also get insurance for the sale of the tree You can also get insurance for the sale of the tree You can also get insurance for the sale of the tree If all the farmers in the village buy this tree, they can protect the trees You can buy this tree in any type of soil This is adapted to all environmental conditions I hope you also grow trees in your garden and increase your income Thank you Since Dr. Soil has started to grow, I have increased my income
