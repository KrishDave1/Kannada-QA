 Namaskar! Welcome to Atmeyar Raitar with Sanchi TV News. Today we have come to Kottalagi village. We have come to the village of Srikandada Gidakala Mahitya. Till today, the situation has been like this. There were two Srikandada Gidakala on the hill. We don't know when they will take them away from the stone. But in the Taluka of Belagav district, in Kottalagi village, one farmer left all the traditional fields and started a Srikandada farm. That too in Hattuekara. Come and get to know that farmer. And also come and get to know all the Srikandada Gidakala Mahitya. Come and get to know the farmer first. My name is Sidra Irapa, from L.D. I am from Belagavanjala, in the Taluka of Atmeyar Raitar, Kottalagi. I used to do farming. My ancestors used to do farming. Later I started farming. How did you get the idea to start a Srikandada Gidakala farm? Now, if we want to start a Srikandada farm, it will be done on its own. Because, when we do it on our own, we are doing it by ourselves. The labor rate has increased. The rate of cow dung has increased. The rate of medicine has increased. Now, in terms of investment, in the absence of work, the situation has become like this. Now, Menaka Nagamma's family, if they have their own family, they can work and earn their living. Now, we have to work like this. If we have to water the fields, we have to work from the side. We have to work from the side. If we work from the side, we can earn our living. If we work from the side, we can earn our living. How many acres of Srikandada Gidakala have you planted? How many trees have you planted in one acre? How many trees have you planted in the middle? I planted Srikandada Gidakala in 10 acres of land. In total, I planted 80 acres of land. In 80 acres, I have planted 10-15% of the land. Now, in one acre, I have planted 325 trees. How much is the difference? There are 16 trees on one side and 8 trees on the other side. Now, I have planted 300 trees. In total, I have planted 300 trees in 3 acres. In total, I have planted 300 trees in 3 acres. I have been planting trees for the past 3 years. Now, it is 3 years. If we plant trees in the front, it will take another 2-3 years. We have been planting trees for 1 year. We have been seeing many such trees. We cannot use any other example. We have planted trees in the same color as the trees. At the same time, the trees are growing. In the same forest, we have planted trees in the 3-4 years. We have been thinking about this since long. We have taken the responsibility to protect this forest. We have taken the responsibility to protect this forest. This is our task. How many kinds of species are there in Srikandada forest? And what kind of species of forests do you plant? How do you manage the land? When we are in Srikanth, we have different castes. We have one caste. In any other country, we have only one. In Srikanth, we have a small village. We have a small village. We have different castes. We have a big village. We have different castes. We have two castes. But when we go abroad, we have to go to Canada. We have to make a difference there. If we have different castes, we can get a 20% increase in the rate. We can get a higher rate. We can get a higher rate on the land and on the climate. What are the medicines you use to make the land more fertile? In Srikanth, we have soft soil. We make the soil soft and make the soil dry. Then we can make the soil dry. We have to see the soil. We have to plant the seeds in the ground. We have to make the soil dry. We have to plant the seeds in the ground.

Such ë°€k years of Srich basis of parts is 8.9 salary. 16 years ago we could have got 1 lakh rupees from one place. We could have got 1 lakh easily. Before, 16 years ago we didn't have any money. For one year we had 10% more money. For 28 years we didn't have any money. For 20 years we had only 1 lakh rupees. For 16 years we had 1 lakh rupees. For 5 years we had only 1 lakh rupees. This is the reason why we have been able to get it. We can get it if we need it. Otherwise we wouldn't have got this much money. If we didn't get the rate, we would have got 1 lakh rupees. This is the reason why we have been able to get it. Who allowed you to build the Shrikhanda Gidai? The reason why we don't need any permission is because our farmers don't know about this. The government allowed us to build it when we were around 70 years old. We were only 70 years old. But we need our permission to build it. We have been here for 8 years. But we don't have the permission to build it. This is the reason why we're creating a space for all the farmers to build their own Gidai. We can't allow them to build more. That's why we are here. and this is the new one and you have not picked any other tree in Srikandha Gita? this is the Srikandha Savolambi tree this is Paravolambi tree this is the Chogisitri tree this tree is called Chogisitri tree where it was planted?
