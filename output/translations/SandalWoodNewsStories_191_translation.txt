 This is a 9 year old tree, almost the roots are now being harvested This is a old tree, but the roots are still there This is a full hardwood tree, friends You can change the roots even if they fall You will understand when you see this video Hi, Namaskara, welcome to Darugru Today's video is about the old tree What to do if the tree falls I will tell you how to grow it I will give you some information This video is shot at an optical angle It is shot at a slightly horizontal angle You can see here, all the trees are cut down If there is no smell, the trees are left like that There are about 2000 trees here There is a fence border There is nothing beyond the fence It was open because it was 8 years old You can see that the trees are not very big Naturally, they were left as they were But the next night, this video was shot in the rain We did it that much late What they did was, they cut down the trees at night They said there was no smell They are leaving it I will show you what kind of smell they have When they are completely burned But what you have to do in this condition As soon as they are cut There is a paste called Beltox Friends, you have to kill it Fungal infection should not occur The tree is still alive Even if it is cut, it will live Cells will develop It will not give the same effect If you put the Beltox paste tightly If you see the air coming out of one place It will definitely grow again Friends, there is no doubt about it The second thing is No need to put electric fencing Then you don't have to put it Whatever you were doing The smell With other crops First give protection They have completely burned the tree So as I said For protection, use electric fencing first Use the same as the other plants Use the same as the other plants It is not wrong to use the same as the other plants Okay, so if you put it in the same way We are even happier Because you can contribute to nature If you go to the carbon sequestration Then it will come to the ground It will be 80-90% protection So as I said It is mixed with the flour And other crops But the host is mango I will tell you that too If you don't know about the host Then you can do the 9th year plantation Okay, when they do it for 9 years They don't have access to research They don't have internet They don't have time to go and do it Because they are government employees They don't have time to go and do it We can't do anything about this Because the age is almost 80-90 See, you can see it there So what to do about it Plan first I don't want to do it for another 8-10 years What I am doing in this field for the last 10 years I am not utilizing it properly So if you want to do it Then I have to pay attention to it Take one For 2000 Almost 800-900 They have cut it For some people it is good They have cut it because the owner is there They have completed it after a long time So if you watch this video Or if you want to do it properly Please understand If you have a fence and no planting material Pay attention to the host If the host is not there properly, growth will not happen If growth happens and you have no fence If you don't have proper planning, cutting will happen So if you have two If you don't pay attention to one If you don't pay attention to the other There will be a chance of loss I will show you one more What will happen if you give the host wrong Here you can see Shrikhanda's 2 year old plot Good retail Shrikhanda came This is the pomegranate plot If you see the size of the plant It is growing well But if you see the pomegranate Everything is growing well Why does the pomegranate grow?
