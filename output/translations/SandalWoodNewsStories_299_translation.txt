 Mom, we shouldn't have been born as beggars. Why dad? What happened to you? What has become of you? Not like that mom. We should have money, wealth and everything in our house. Only then we will be happy. Don't say like that Muthu. We should be happy in whatever we have. We shouldn't feel bad. Mom, if we are poor, we can't earn money. Mom, my friends are making money. But I am still doing business and not here. I have enough money. I have enough money. I don't understand anything. Wealth can be lived in peace only if we have money. Wealth is a thing of the poor. If we want to earn money, we should have a way. Mom, I will go. Muthu, where are you going? Come here. I have some time. I have to go for business. Please wait for a while. I will talk to you. You will be happy. But not for me. If I go for business, I and my wife and children will be happy. This is my situation. Why are you saying like this? I am not saying like that. This is my situation. Why are you saying like this? Will someone throw a bomb in the sky? Think about it. What are you saying? Don't you know? When the I am telling you, don't throw a bomb in the sky. This will clean the air and give you good health. If you want to grow this precious tree, you won't get it easily. I am telling you the truth. It is true what Kesava and Sanjiva say. We can't spend our time and money on these trees. Why do we need to spend our money now? I have thought about it. I have told people to cut down the trees and change them. What are you saying? I don't agree to this. You tell me what you want. I will do it. Greetings, Your Highness. You are the King and I am the King. I have brought some gifts for your birthday. Is it? What is that? The Thank you for making me happy. Please accept this gift. Thank you, Your Highness. Mother, where are you? Look, your son has been poisoned. This is an unusual poison. Oh, God. I will tell the doctor now. What is this? This is very dangerous. I will tell the doctor to take a tree for this. If he gives it to me, he will be fine. There is no other medicine other than that. I will take it wherever the doctor says. That is a different tree called Ratna. You should give it to him and take him to this poison. But, I don't think it is a good medicine. I will take it to the doctor. I will take it to the doctor. Oh, God. That is a very dangerous poison. If you say like this, I will take my son to the doctor. I will give you a lot of money. You don't have to do the work of building houses. If you give me the gold I have lost, you will be able to save your life. You can't kill yourself because of money. Oh, God. Sir, your father has given us water, firewood and corn. We trees don't let the firewood burn. That is why I am doing you a favor. You have destroyed our land. Instead, you should burn us in the fire. And burn your son's soul. Drink water. He will be free from the poison. Do as I say. Please forgive me. I won't do such mistakes again. I will burn the trees like my father.
