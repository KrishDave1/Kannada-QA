 When you start planting in June, you don't know when another rain will come If you don't take this risk, you will get a good harvest If the plants are good, the water will be good, the water will be good If you plant a little bit of fungi on the pesticide, you will get a root shock If you plant a little bit of the root shock, you will get a root shock If you spray some little chilled termites or upsetanth enforcable,�들 might proceed to do some work If you get a little moreiert, your plant will get protected When you plant that plant, you are sure to do that when the primary growth wither Soap Then the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one Swamy whouksai. So when you begin, you come in front of the primary host, and peculiarly, after the primary host comes in the second appeal you start the second communication. If you look at the three trees, all the trees are straight. None of the trees are connected to this tree. Have you observed? None of the trees are connected to this tree. Then the trees that come around this tree, the root connection comes from three trees. The tree starts in the morning. We are looking at the condition of that tree. If you are going to suppress that tree, you have to control that tree. You have to control the growth by cutting it. We can cut only one tree, sir. You can cut only one tree, sir. The advantages of cutting only one tree are less. That's why if you cut different trees, different trees, different nutrients will also go. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. Different trees will have different nutrients. The trees that are near the tree will also go automatically. This is one. The roots of the sand will not stay here. The roots will start spreading out. So, if you keep one tree 5 meters away from the other, there will be space in the tree. In this space, you can grow papaya, or even a crop that is not grown in a year or two, or a crop that is not grown in a year or two, or a crop that is not grown in a year or two, or a crop that is not grown in a year or two, you can take a crop that is demultitionally grown. One can take a crop that is demultitionally grown, but it will not stay there 5 years. One can take it, but not very better, because if unwanted weeds grow in future, you can take a ears of that without any atenuometer. You can take a tractor, maintain it, and in 5 years, a flower will be a little cushioned. a cover, your head cover, and let it grow in such a way, so the As I said in Survival Earlier, sandals will suit the dr drylands Now the question arises, Sir, is it possible to get a cup mandi? In Vijapur, there is a cup mandi. Is it possible to get a cup mandi? They have made a low sandal here. But what happens there? There is a small clay in the cup mandi. When the clay is dry, the cracks are formed. When the cracks are formed, the tree's bear is exposed to air. When the air is exposed, the bear stands on the sandal. It is bent. The growth is bent. What does it do? If someone is standing on the sandal, when the cracks are formed, the disc is operated and the sand is crushed. Do you understand? They give irrigation. There is a situation to manage all this. But when the cap is broken, no problems are seen. This is what you have to understand. Next, there is another line. This line is the middle. In this line, if you are standing 5 meters away, you can get a neem plant. You can get it ready. Because this crop will cross the road. That crop will have a root. The neem plant will also go this way. It will supply nutrients. If it gets a neem plant, I will show you the photo. Do you understand? You have to stand like this. No, no. You have to stand like this. What I am saying is, Sir, I am saying that no matter what tree you come from, there is no danger of other trees dying. It is sandalwood. Do you understand? Because if that tree dies, you will not get lost. But sandalwood is not easy. It is very difficult. If that tree dies, it will be sandalwood. Do you understand? What is the need to supply nutrients to a tree that is sandalwood? Pay attention to that. Here, you have been here for 5 years. Now, your tree is dying. The surrounding tree will be a little further away. In that space, if you have planted 4 plants, you will be growing them. You will be producing them. In between, there is no space. Between those 4 plants, you have to plant a permanent host. The permanent host can be a farm, or a vendor. If you have 20 years, you can plant some other plants. You can select the high yielding dwarf varieties and keep them ready. Do you understand? If you want to grow forest crops, or timber, timber is used as sandalwood. This also requires more competition. That is why, the primary product is wood. This is the primary product, wood. So, there is competition between the two products. If you plant it on the ground, like in Srinivaspur, you have to plant it in the ground. What happens there? The tree will be bigger. It will give you more energy. There is no trouble. There is no problem. If you plant fruit crops, you will get less yield. But this is not a problem. If you plant tree crops, you will get good yield. Another thing is the milled oak tree. Milled oak trees are very popular. Milled oak trees will be taken away, they will get dark in 4-5 years, sandalwood will need a whistle, it will get dark, it will not give a whistle. If you plant it, someone will get it. If you plant it, sandalwood will fall out. If you plant it, the tree will fall out. If you plant it, the tree will fall out. If you plant it, the tree will fall out. So, because of all these problems, management is very important. For that, we have a jungle tree, if we plant it, it will get 15 years of yield. If we plant it, we will get 15 years of yield. There is a concept. It is not sensitive. You don't damage barks. Bark is a protective layer. If you block the bark, it will go inside and get more. There is a reason for that. Another thing is, even if you plant it 5-5 meters, when the branches spread, the tractor movements will stop. If you go to a small tree, and the tractor doesn't damage, it is okay. If the tractor damages, it will stop. Did you hear our plantation? Did you hear about Madhagiri? Did you hear about it? There, 17 years ago, we had an advertisement. We did videos and took photos. It was very bad. Because, they expected 10 kg yield. It was not wrong. But what did they do? When they did the tractor operation, we didn't see it. The water entered from the well. The water was very hot. Did you do it? Yes. What did you do? These are our lessons. I didn't come up with any new ideas. I saw Kannara, and I heard about the other guys and I will tell you. Because, so many ideas haven't come to the book yet. Understood? So, take these very carefully and take time every day or once a week, and stand in every room and see the condition, what is the problem. Then you will see, there are many solutions in your local.
