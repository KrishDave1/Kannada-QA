 Aathaa is a woman who has built her life in agriculture. Aathaa who saw the success of Sri Gandhada's birth is now a mother to everyone. She is famous not only in our country but also abroad. Who is Aathaa? Watch this story. Aathaa who saw Sri Gandhada's birth in the early days is called Vishu Kumar. In the district of Chikka Manguru, Sri Gandhada's person is famous. A few years back, no one knew about Vishu Kumar. But TV9 published a news article about Vishu Kumar's birth. After that, many people started coming to know about Vishu Kumar. Sri Gandhada's birth was also discussed about Lalana Pallan. The famous Vishu Kumar who was famous in the street and street, is now famous in foreign countries. In Africa, Vishu Kumar has brought him to his country and has been informed about Lalana Pallan. I saw a program called Gandhada Gudi about Sri Gandhada's agriculture. Many people from the state came here to learn about Sri Gandhada. They also went to learn about Sri Gandhada and started farming. I had come to work from Africa. They were very happy and gave us seeds for our sample. We planted the seeds, planted them and if anything happens to our land, they promised to give us permission. In Malavi, Vishu Kumar, who was the Ismail Emperor, was informed about Sri Gandhada. In Sri Gandhada, the government of Lalana was allowed to bring Vishu Kumar to his country. Vishu Kumar is still happy about this opportunity. We are very happy about this. In Chipanguru district, Vishu Kumar is a very good farmer. Similarly, I would like to ask the government and Sri Gandhada farmers to help us. I would like to ask them to bring more farmers like Vishu Kumar to their country. Vishu Kumar, who was a millionaire, has become a farmer. He has provided information to other farmers. He has also provided the information to foreigners about our country. I wish Vishu Kumar becomes a farmer like this.
