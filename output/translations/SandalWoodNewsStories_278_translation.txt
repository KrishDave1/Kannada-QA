 Now, every day, we are bringing to you the stories of the four parts of the state, the farmer Yashogathe and their experiences. But today, we are introducing you to various farmers. Yes, from a young age, they grow and grow and grow new crops. They are inspired by these farmers. Gandhada Bedu, Sri Gandhada Nadu, is a famous state in Karnataka. We must be proud of this. First, the farmers of Sri Gandhada did not grow their crops on their own land. But, there is no problem. The government is also encouraging this growing. So, the farmer's farming has started in different parts of the state since the last few years. Many farmers have grown their crops since the last few days. In the small village of Bailusime, Gopalakrishna, Kolar district, Sri Gandhada, a small farmer has grown his crop in 12 acres. Here, you are seeing the half-settled village of Kolar, the garden of Gopalakrishna. The fields of Sri Gandhada here are about 6 years old. There are no more than 2000 trees here. The farmers are trying to get water from the water source. Sri Gandhada Faravalambi Gita. The farmer Gopalakrishna says that the crop has been grown in the garden. In the half-settled village, in survey no. 59, I have grown 12 acres of Sri Gandhada. When I grow Sri Gandhada, I want to plant Faravalambi with it. The water source is not sufficient for this garden. So, we have planted it with this garden. It needs water for 2 years. We have planted it with drip. The reason for the pruning is that the Gita has developed. We have not done pruning from the lower part of the Gita. We have taken only 3 feet of the Gita from the lower part. We have taken the soil from the lower part of the Gita. We have left everything there. It has been 6 years since we have planted it. It is not growing well until it is fully grown. It is growing slowly. The reason is that the soil is not growing well. The department says that the soil will start growing after 10-12 years. As per me, it will take 20 years. Today, people want to plant the soil. They are preparing for the soil to be planted in the farm. Now, more than 500 people have planted the soil. We are planting the seeds in the middle. The seeds are the flour, tomatoes, beans, papaya. We have done all kinds of pruning and we have been doing it for 6 years. We have taken the soil from the soil and we are doing it. Sri Gandha is a very strong tree. It is a big fear for the farmers who are trying to plant the soil. The trees that have been planted for 20 years, if they are not fed, they become very expensive and can be used for destruction. It takes time and effort. So, the government should make a good arrangement for the protection of Sri Gandha trees. This is the opinion of Gopalakrishna. Today, if it is smelly, all the farmers will be scared. If it is smelly, they will plant it in the DC office, in the government buildings, in the forest. They will be scared of how you will improve. We have planted it.

Because, as you can see, the rate we get today, the same rate is given to every farmer twice. So, the rate is reduced and the farmers are in a situation to commit suicide by using the same rate.

They have to register in that website. We also issue them a work order. After that, they can get the seedlings from the NHP accredited or forest department and get the crop from their department. The next process is to apply the seedlings. We submit the seedlings to the farmers and we use the RTA to deposit the seedlings to their account. It's very simple.
