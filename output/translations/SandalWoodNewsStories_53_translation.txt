 So now I am putting increment borer to test the hot wood formation in the sun root tree. It is around 4 and half year old tree and girth is around 40 cm. And I am putting increment borer to remove the core sample to test the hot wood of the tree. So now I am putting increment borer. It is going inside and after that we remove the core sample. So in that core sample we can test the hot wood as well as sharp wood. Spoon please. Now I have applied spoon and removing the core sample. So you will know what is the extent of hot wood here? Not yet started. I think light smell is there. I think there is initiation of conversion. Yes, it is the indication of formation of hot wood in the young tree. Congratulations Vinay. It is not started yet. How do we close it? Will there be any effect? We will put one stick to close the hole. Within three months it will ignite.
