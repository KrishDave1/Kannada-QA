aud Back to healer It is a parasite. It cannot generate its nutrients. It can absorb nutrients from other trees. Now you may not have trees nearby. But there are lots of weeds here. That is why it has its nutrients. But according to our demonstration, where we have planted the seedlings, the seedlings will survive. It will give good nutrients to the weeds. It is non-irrigation. Is the distance too much? No, if you put it too much, it is one or two feet. If you go to the forest, the weeds are not far away. The roots are half a foot away. The roots should be locked. It will survive. After 18-20 years, due to the diversity of crops, you will get different crops. You can grow agricultural crops here. You can grow oilseeds here. But after 18-20 years, the roots will become permanent. But we don't say that it is the only plant. We don't have a host plant. We don't have anything to hold the roots. We want to plant a plant in the diversity. We want to plant 50-60 plants in one acre. This is the food forest. We want to have food and forest. We get wood for the forest. It helps nature. We want to have food. We have three varieties of seed. This is red and that is golden. This is gold. This is peanut butter. What we think of these plants is... Look at this tomato. This is a seed. This is a natural pulse. Tomatoes are grown here. Farmers use it for growing trees. Tomatoes can grow 10 tons. But when we grow only one, we get food and food. We need to have a long-term and short-term crop. When farmers retire, they can plant only the seeds and the seeds. This is a 30-year crop. It has been five years. It has been two years since then. We need to have a host plant ecosystem. Roots should be there. We need to grow more trees. This is called... Is it native? No, it is not. It is our own soil. Thank you for watching.
