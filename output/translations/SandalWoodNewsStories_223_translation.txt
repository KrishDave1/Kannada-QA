 I had eaten 10 white food and there was no white food and no hot food. I had to go to the National Park in Madhavaketa. They are making me alone. I should know what is going on. Do you have any doubts about anyone? No, I don't have any doubts. CCTV cameras are making me alone. I should know what is going on. Thank you Gokul for talking to us.
